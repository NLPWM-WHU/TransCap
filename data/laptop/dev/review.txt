The sheer power and flexibility makes the MacBook Pro a must have for any techie!
But sitting on a lap or on a desk in front of you it looks more than big enough (this could be because Im used to my Lenovo 10 tablet now) plus this is a great size if I want to unplug the external keyboard, mouse, and monitor to take it with me when I take photos and video.
I charge it at night and skip taking the cord with me because of the good battery life.
I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP (what I thought was a reputable company) wouldn't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart.
Very fast boot up and shut down.
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were.
The battery life sucked the juice from my laptop and when the extended life battery went out we were SOL there to, so much for that warranty covering all the products we purchased.
We upgraded the memory to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed.
Also, macbooks come with much more features which are so cool!
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.
They also have a longer service life than other computers (I have several friends who still use the older Apple PowerBooks).
Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.
First of all, they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty I'd paid almost $400 for, and I had to call in, spend hours on their online chat service, and fax in multiple documents.
The track pad to me is what really stands out though, you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad, awesome thinking Apple!
The brand of iTunes has just become ingrained in our lexicon now, but keep in mind that Apple started it all.
The dv4 boasted a faster processor, more memory, and a bigger hard drive than my old computer, plus a better quality web cam, nicer screen, and many other features.
The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC  Specs: Like I said this performs a lot better than any computer I've had in the past.
It is easy to use, has great screen quality, and every so light weight.
Upgrading from Windows 7 Starter, thru Windows 7 Home Premium, to Windows 7 Professional was a snap;
Three weeks after I bought the netbook, the screen quit working.
It is always reliable, never bugged and responds well.
4) Laptop still did not work, blue screen within a week...
The games included are very good games.
I had read online that some users were having sound problems.
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in a room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard.
The dv4 boasted a faster processor, more memory, and a bigger hard drive than my old computer, plus a better quality web cam, nicer screen, and many other features.
I guess the only good thing that came out of these were the speakers and the subwoofer.
On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad.
I purchased this netbook after my original Toshiba laptop crashed right after the warranty expired.
And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming.
The difference in the Apple keyboard from a PC's keyboard took a bit of tim to get used to, but overall it's worth it!
The screen resolution was exactly what I was looking for.
The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space (500GB instead of 320GB) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk.
The battery life, before the battery completely died of course, left much to be desired.
Then just the other day, my left "mouse" button snapped!
the i3 processor doesn't seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on.
Its Office compatible, but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs.
It is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user, that makes it run way to slow.
The programs are great, like iphoto (love the editing capabilities), imail (which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad), imovie, etc.
It is easy to use, its keyboard easily accommodates large hands, and its weight is fantasic.
Boots up fast and runs great!
Its ease of use and the top service from Apple- be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar- cannot be beat.
A SECOND PROBLEM INVOLVES THE BATTERY WHICH IS ADVERTISED AS HAVING A STORAGE LIFE OF 11 HOURS BUT WHEN FULLY CHARGED SHOWS ONLY 7 HOURS OF SERVICE.
And the warranty on this macbook pro can last up to 5 years or 1000 battery recharge cycles.
Like the price and operation.
A month or so ago, the freaking motherboard just died.
This is what I call a good after sales service.
My one complaint with this laptop is that I've noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in.
So I called Compaq, and after being on the phone for 3 hours, i finally got a replacement which I shouldn't have had a problem getting since it was under warranty.
Great Laptop for the price, works well with action pack games.
The processor screams, and because of the unique way that Apple OSX 16 functions, most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software.
Later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months.
This is a review of windows vista system.
iTunes is a handy music-management program, and it is essential for anyone with an iPod.
This process continued to repeat itself until the mother board had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times.
-4 RAM slots, 2 HDD Bays*, 16GB RAM support -No Wireless Issues, at least for me.
also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
I was told by many  that it was a great computer, but we got one of these, and it worked  great for one year, and as soon as the warrenty was up, then it got  really bad.
Next, most Acer laptop fans are on the bottom which is right on your laptop.
It doesnt work worth a damn.
The Mac takes about the same amount of starting-up time as the average PC, but keeps itself cleaned up and ready to use.
I would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use, stylish, fun, awesome computer.
I am not sure if it was the drive itself, however;
It is fast booting up , shutting down, and connection with the internet.
I contacted Acer and they are giving me FREE recovery DVDs, so don't go and pay for them, just ask for them and they should give them to you.
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed.
It had most of the features and all of the power that I wanted to replace my desktop machine.
Wireless has not been a issue for me, like some others have meantioned.
I love my Apple, it is quick and easy to use.
After doing extensive research, macconnection had the lowest price on the 15" MBP i5.
Overall : Poor, Features: Average, Performance: Poor, Battery Life: Excellent, Price-Value: Poor
Also, if you need to talk to a representive at Microsoft, there is a charge, which I believe is robbery, since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system, which most people would have went with XP if they could.
everything about a mac is wonderful, it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new system, but you will learn fast and its all worth it.
In desparation, I called their Customer Service number and was told that my warranty had expired (2 days old) and that the priviledge of talking to a technician would cost me ("have your credit card ready").
the touch pad is fine - again, it's a real touch pad.
The iLife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces a great finished product.
The screen is framed by half- to a full-inch margin that is obviously unnecessary, reduces the screen size and increases the bulk.
I'm really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer.
( The iBook backup also uses a firewire connection).
InÂ November my computer messed up entirely and wouldn't power on after intalling a Windows update, I had to have my HD flashed and lost EVERYTHING on it, including my school assignments and irriplaceable pictures that were only in digital format and several other things, when this update was installed for some reason I was unable to roll back the drivers and everything to an earlier working condition because when the update was installed it deleted my history.
The start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking.
Though the picture, video, and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software Im used to (CS5) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers.
For the same price, you get a lot more in the Asus....1920x1080 res.
Oh yeah, don't forget the expensive shipping to and from HP.
I run Dreamweaver, Final Cut Pro 7, Photoshop, Safari, Firefox, MSN Messenger and a few other applications constantly at the same time.
The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac, and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $60 500gb external hard drive.
I have had no problems with it unlike some hardware defects on past models.
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more memory and hard drive space.
The online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used a PC.
The people there just changed for me on the spot and I got a new arm piece and they didn't even request for a receipt.
The Nortons virus scan is only for a very short time unlike others that usually are good for a year.
With what I do know how to do, the computer works beautiful.
previous laptops were pc's, still have them, but the mac osx is a clean and smooth operating system.
but it  has a major design flaw.
My real problem with it? The statement of 7 hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration -- it's a lie.
It has come into good use for my finances, scheduling, my parents business expenses, and it is definitely amazing for gaming.
It has bein into the shop to get a new hardrive 2 times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard!
It's like 9 punds, but if you can look past it, it's GREAT!
The only thing is that the battery won't last more than 1/2 an hour.
After numerous calls to Applecare tech support, I was directed to send in my computer;
I also like the acer arcade but these were reallythe only two things I liked about this laptop.
But the biggest pain is that tech support is not available 24/7.
BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + (sales, service, respect for old men who aren't familiar with the technology) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple
The port is secured to motherboard so when this  happens you can't see the plug at all, it's just gone.
The keyboard is too slick.
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have.
With a mac you don't have to worry about antivirus software or firewall, it's so wonderful.
If internet connectivity is important I would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more, or buy a USB wireless card.
Fan vents to the side, so no cooling pad needed, great feature!
Though the picture, video, and music software is nowhere close to professional grade software Im used to (CS5) but does the job for beginner and even intermediate media designers.
There is no cd drive on the computer, which defeats the purpose of keeping files on a cd.
after much effort and 10 days ASUS replaced itThe WiFi is very weak.
Although i do believe that Windows operating system may be to fault for some of the problems.
Despite the claims of the Apple apologists (a vice of which I am recently myself reformed) the internals of Mac laptops are NO different from PCs' at this point.
BUT there's this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows.
Product support very poor as each phone call costs me long distan
Enabling the battery timer is useless.
Garageband is more for the musicians, and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone, good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level.
I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid, (mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed) but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out.
A coupla months later, they change my hard drive.
I have never really been big on downloading anything so I wasn't too worried about getting a virus, plus I thought I was protected by Norton.
Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed, etc.
It is light and the battery last a very long time.
The gray color was a good choice.
They say that this will invalidate the warranty on the hard drive (I don't really understand why but anyway).
Reason why? It's because when you buy it, you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop, the price will stay the same for the next year, and even if Apple does decides to change mode, your laptop value will only drop 10-20%, unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80%.
After about a week I finally got it back and was told that the motherboard had failed and so they installed a new motherboard.
While Apple's saving grace is the fact that they at least stand behind their products, and their support is great, it would be nice if their products were more reliable to justify the premium.
It was hard to handle and operate at school.
Have had many higher priced computers crash and burn long before ever got to use all that great memory and speed, etc.
It's so much easier to navigate through the operating system, to find files, and it runs a lot faster!
It's also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing).
-4 RAM slots, 2 HDD Bays*, 16GB RAM support -No Wireless Issues, at least for me.
The touchpad is very intuitive, so much so that I never want to use buttons to click again!
Great laptop that offers many great features!
Not to mention, the battery life is absolutely amazing.
My favorite part of this computer is that it has a vga port so I can connect it to a bigger screen.
(I found a 2GB stick for a bit under $50) Nice and portable and definitely a decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for a couple of hours, or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents.
It could be a perfect laptop if it would have faster system memory and its radeon 5850 would have DDR5 instead of DDR3.
Battery is not upgradable to a longer life battery.
Screen is awesome, battery life is good.
You can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy o boy does it ever.
The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft.
I dual boot with Linux and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly.
The computer is currently in West Verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by Toshiba.
There is a small red circle next to it with a x in the middle, and when I click on it it says: " Consider replacing your battery" and it does not hold full charge.
Fully charged, the MacBook Pro can last about five hours unplugged.
It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours.
Great OS, fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port.
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch-pad making the touch-pad hard to use when using headphones/mic, not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person.
The screen is a little glary, and I hated the clicking buttons, but I got used to them.
apple has a reputation and is well known for its easy usage.
I am not much of a computer techie, so I can understand some ofÂ the internal problems, though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program.
The board has a bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues.
The buttons you have to press a little harder than most.
My husband got me this for Chrismas after getting me a very expensve laptop that did not work after 2 days.
My wireless system would not recognize Windows 7 and I couldn't get online to find out why.
BEST BUY - 5 STARS + + + (sales, service, respect for old men who aren't familiar with the technology) DELL COMPUTERS - 3 stars DELL SUPPORT - owes a me a couple
Features like the font are very block-like and old school.
The touch pad is among the best.
The Material this Pro is made out of seems a lot nicer than any PC  Specs: Like I said this performs a lot better than any computer I've had in the past.
I love the way the entire suite of software works together.
Also, one of the users mentioned how the edges on the macbook is sharp, if you have money to spend on one of the incase shells, it doesn't seem to be a problem.
Adjust the sensitivity since it's not that responsive to begin with.
I had to pay for the shipping!
Startup in about 30 seconds, shutdown in 2-4 seconds, resume from sleep in 0-2 seconds.
There is a backlit keyboard which is perfect for typing in the dark.
Other installed features, such as certain printer software, are also most attractive.
Acer was no help and Garmin could not determine the problem(after spending about 2 hours with me), so I returned it and purchased a Toshiba R700 that seems even nicer and I was able to load all of my software with no problem.
The computer continued to give me issues and in Late June it completely died again and I tried to call Acer again to get it fixed and they refused to help me, they said my warrenty was up and hung up on me.
However, the multi-touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary (unless you're gaming).
It is easy to use, fast and has great graphics for the money.
We also use Paralles so we can run virtual machines of Windows XP Professional, Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows Server Enterprise 2003, and Windows Server 2008 Enterprise.
Sure, the initial out of pocket expense is greater, but that should not dissuade anyone from the fact that these machines run like none other on the planet, and when I factor in all the money in that I wasted on Geek Squad and the latest patches to de-corrupt my infested PCs, it probably comes out about even anyhow.
Right size and weight for portability.
My battery went bad about a year and a half after having it and it cost around eighty to a hundred dollars!
Its pretty fast and does not have hiccups while I am using it for web browsing, uploading photos, watching movies (720p) on occasion and creating presentations.
I regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use.
Disappointing for such a lovely screen and at a reasonable price
(No problem with the ordering or shipping by the way.
BUT there's this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows.
I've owned this labtop for less then two months, already the mouse button has broke.
In fact, somehow (and I never opened it up) some specks of dust or something got inside the screen and are now there permanently, behind the front of the screen, in the way of the display.
I love the operating system and the preloaded software.
First of all, they had no record of me having the 3 year warranty I'd paid almost $400 for, and I had to call in, spend hours on their online chat service, and fax in multiple documents.
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which I am used to it being on the side.
One night I turned the freaking thing off after using it, the next day I turn it on, no GUI, screen all dark, power light steady, hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does.
The guy then said that if I insist on having the hinge tightened, they can do it for me but I have to accept the condition after the "repair".
I am first time Mac Buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the Mac offers.
Laptop is advertised as a 15" but the casing looks like that of a 17".
You can call HP and they want you to buy more software to fix it.
This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.
My kids (and dogs) destroyed two power cords by pulling on them.
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like a charm.
The ease of use is wonderful.
I also purchased iWork to go with it which has programs for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations (similar to Microsoft Office).
Keyboard was also very nice and had a solid feel.
While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at, I think there's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs.
However, I love this particular Mac because its very fast, great size, and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad.
I cannot be happier with the service or product.
2.The wireless card is low quality.
I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times.
My laptop now has no battery.
The speed difference is next to NOTHING for a mac, and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $60 500gb external hard drive.
Love the graphics, awesome programs (including Garageband), and really cool default background.
The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
We have had numerous problems with Vista, such as Adobe Flash player just quits and has to be uninstalled and then reinsalled, Internet Explore just quits and you lose whatever you were working on, also, the same Windows update has appeared on this computer since we got it and has been updated probably 400 times, the same update.
The screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution.
If you want more information on macs I suggest going to apple.com and heading towards the macbook page for more information on the applications.
Runs smooth and quick.
We also use Paralles so we can run virtual machines of Windows XP Professional, Windows 7 Home Premium, Windows Server Enterprise 2003, and Windows Server 2008 Enterprise.
First, it does not have a push button to open the lid.
First, you ll discover that the word processing program known as  Appleworks  rarely translates perfectly on anyone else s computer, if it translates at all.
Came fully loaded - good.
The little battery that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop.
But see the macbook pro is different because it may have a huge price tag but it comes with the full software that you would actually need and most of it has free future updates.
That included the extra Sony Sonic Stage software, the speakers and the subwoofer I got (that WAS worth the money), the bluetooth mouse for my supposedly bluetooth enabled computer, the extended life battery and the Docking port.
This computer is exceptionally thin for it's screen size and processing power.
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i've ever seen.
It has a 10 hour battery life when you're doing web browsing and word editing, making it perfect for the classroom or office, and in terms of gaming and movie playing it'll have a battery life of just over 5 hours.
The battery never held a charge longer than one hour and within two months, stopped holding a charge for more than ten minutes.
I had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity, because it is very sensitive.
For the not so good, I got the stock screen - which is VERY glossy.
Summary: I've had this laptop for 2 months, out of the blue the power adapter stops working.
Because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened.
Wasted me at least 8 hours of installation time.
It really is perfect for work and play.
I know what 7 hrs of battery looks like.
Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.
Skype is just so dang cool with this machine too.
The resolution on the screen is almost pure HD.
But to be honest, I don't use my computer for anything like graphics editing and complex data analysis and gaming.
I love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new Toshiba works great on both!
Still under warrenty so called Toshiba, no help at all.
tons of bloatware and junk programs.
After talking it over with the very knowledgeable sales associate, I chose the MacBook Pro over the white MacBook.
Long story, but after many calls to various  offices, I was told that no one can override the depot and that managers  don't take phone calls or e/mails.
Speaking of the browser, it too has problems.
I had in the past a Dell laptop and they sent me the items it needed or they sent a repair technician to my house to fix it.
The tech guy then said the service center does not do 1-to-1 exchange and I have to direct my concern to the "sales" team, which is the retail shop which I bought my netbook from.
I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid, (mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed) but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out.
Keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable.
High price tag, however.
Great Laptop for the price, works well with action pack games.
It is easy to operate and I have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new Rolls Royce of laptops.
the laptop preformed pretty well.
No, tey don't even support their own bios and it "could be a problem with the bios" How can a company that makes a fairly decent product get away with such insanity??!!
Reason why? It's because when you buy it, you know first thing that you will not lose any value for that laptop, the price will stay the same for the next year, and even if Apple does decides to change mode, your laptop value will only drop 10-20%, unlike PC laptops which drop more than 80%.
I have found it very easy to use, very imformative, wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs.
Unless you need the Bluetooth 3.
when i first got it i thought the size of it was a joke.
The ATI graphics card is a huge plus, definitely a good value if you need to be able to run some slightly older games that a Intel built-in card would have trouble with, such as Half-Life 2 or even World of Warcraft.
Even with virus protection, it always turned off when updates were needed and installed.
Its Office compatible, but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs.
This laptop looks great on the surface: 17" inch screen, good  price-point, nice appearance, boots up quickly, runs fast etc.
I love the easy to see screen, and It works well for work, persoal or just play.
It caught a virus that completely wiped out my hard drive in a matter of hours.
they improved nothing else such as Resolution, appearance, cooling system, graphics card, etc.
The OS is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly.
I already have a HP laptop I bought last year that's standard size.
It's also very capable of doing moderate video editing (although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing).
The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.
I acually believe the issue is with the Nvidia grafics card, but still requires a return.
i love the size of the computer since i play games on it.
The store honored their warrenty and made the comment that they don't even recommend the HP brand because of the problems with their warrentys.
Also the display is exceptional!
Even though it is running Snow Leopard, 2.4 GHz C2D is a bit of an antiquated CPU and thus the occasional spinning wheel would appear when running Office Mac applications such as Word or Excel.
It took several weeks just to get them to acknowledge that I owned the warranty.
On my PowerBook G4 I would never use the trackpad I would use an external mouse because I didn't like the trackpad.
It is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not.
I think part of the problem with this computer is Vista, yet I know Vista isn't the entire issue because my latest purchase was my Acer and it also has Vista (I should have waited the few months to get the next operating system).
The biggest problem is that the box had no instructions in it.
The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it's speed.
Bigger HD, better graphics card, and a bid HD.
the only fact i dont like about apples is they generally use safari and i dont use safari but after i install Mozzilla firfox i love every single bit about it.
It didn't take me long to get switched over to the Mac computer programs and navigation - it's been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better.
With all the programs that came with it, such as iLife and iWork, I was set from the very beginning.
The computer loads in about a 1/10th of the time that my PC did, and I have all of the programs that were on my PC.
Laptop is advertised as a 15" but the casing looks like that of a 17".
The rep did not even answer my question, I had to ask him, if he understood what I ask or if he spoke english because he didn't even try to acknowledge my question.
I'm learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages.
also it comes with very useful applications like iphoto that it is the best photo application i have ever had
And that probably explains why I've already had my SATA controller go bad within a year of buying it.
I take it everywhere with me because it's so easy to carry.
And the screen on this thing is absolutely amazing for high quality videos and movies and gaming.
While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at, I think there's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs.
PC never worked right even after BIOS fixed.
If what you need is a machine to do some surfing, email checking, word processing, and watching a movie or two, this is the machine you want.
When I got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct HP told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem.
The price premium is a little much, but when you start looking at the features it is worth the added cash.
The image is great, and the soud is excelent.
While most people say that PCs hold functionality and value and Macs are just pretty to look at, I think there's something to be said about the simplicity of Macs.
My daughter uses it for games, email, facebook, pictures and music.
I think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive, but I rather have a hard copy.
I got it back and my built-in webcam and built-in mic were shorting out anytime I touched the lid, (mind you this was my means of communication with my fiance who was deployed) but I suffered thru it and would constandly have to reset the computer to be able to use my cam and mic anytime they went out.
The video chat is the only thing that is iffy about it but im sure once they unpdate the next version on the macbook book the quality of it will be better.
It's a great product for a great price!
The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop.
Speakers too small to be of any real use.
while the keyboard itself is alright, the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes a hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons.
A longer battery life would have been great - but it meets it's spec quite easily.
More times that not the screen pops up saying I have a bad internet connection, or the page can't be displayed.
It pretty much does everything we could ever need, and looks great to boot.
Accordingly, I have decided to NEVER purchase another HP product (my five year old Compaq) lasted 5-years before the hard drive crashed.
I eventually did the migration from my iMac backup disc which uses USB.
Compared to similarly spec'd PCs, this machine is good value, well built and works easily right out of the box.
It is VERY easy to type on and feels great - besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted.
He has replaced his hard drive twice and (of course) has had to pay for antivirus software every year.
Could not keep up with me and finally the hard drive went out.
Drivers updated ok but the BIOS update froze the system up and the computer shut down.
It does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it.
The downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook: screen size is not something I'd stare at for the entire 10-11 hours of battery life five days a week.
With a MAC computer I have more free time as I don't have to wait for windows to boot up or shut down and all the viruses associated with windows.
I'm still within the one year warranty but the repair "depot"  has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not  covered.
They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based customer service agents for those who live in the United states.
The system constantly overheats, the battery life is too short, the case is coming apart, and my core applications that I use every day in my work as a graphic artist run poorly.
-4 RAM slots, 2 HDD Bays*, 16GB RAM support -No Wireless Issues, at least for me.
It is fast and i have not had a problem with internet connection or any other problems.
STOPPED BOOTING UP less than a week after my one-year warranty was up.
upon giving them the serial number the first thing I was told, was that it was out of warranty and I could pay to have it repaired.
The battery holds up well, it's built very solidly, and runs fast.
So we exchanged it for the same on and after 2 hours it didn't work.
I was looking for a mac which is portable and has all the features that I was looking for.
Only a few days after I received the computer back, the screen froze again.
The price was very good, and the product is top quality.
I need graphic power to run my Adobe Creative apps efficiently.
For some odd reasons the computer doesn't reconize the operation system.
Bigger HD, better graphics card, and a bid HD.
it has 3 usb ports, 1 sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion.
Keyboard is plastic and spongey feeling.
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price, but you cannot find the look, easy, applications, and the experience in mac.
I should have checked this before I installed my applications.
This is a nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life.
The computer itself was fast, ran smoothly, and had no problems.
Comfterbale to use light easy to transport.
So what am I supposed to do?  The LG service center cannot provide me the "service" when it is called the "service center".
I'm tired of the inept service.
The screen graphics and clarity, and sharpness are great.
It's also fairly easy to use the Operating System.
EITHER WAY, THE KEYBOARD IS UNSATISFACTORY.
2 months later, the battery went.
/ awesome cooling system/ much better grafics card (ATI 5870) / 8GB RAM/ LED backlit screen...
Keyboard is reasonable size.
And if you do a lot of writing, editing is a problem since there is no  forward delete  key.
Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.
The switchable graphic card is pretty sweet when you want gaming on the laptop.
I loved the netbook (minus the fact that it was windows OS) until this started happening.
I am not much of a computer techie, so I can understand some ofÂ the internal problems, though I do have trend micro as an antiviral program.
Best thing is I can use existing 32 bit old programs.
The only thing I wish is the 15 inch MacBook Pro has much better speakers on the side of the keyboard.
They replaced my hard drive as well as my mother board.
I was also able to install and use my Photoshop and AfterEffects programs easily.
Its Office compatible, but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs.
It's super fast and a great value for the price!
I have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop.
Tech support tells me the latter problem is a power supply problem and have offered to fix it if it happens again.
The lcd screen stopped working on mine after 10 months.
The computer will constantly be getting hot and burning your leg unless you go through the hassle of taking off the entire back of it just to clean out the fan.
I love the size, keyboard, the functions.
The real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it's speed.
The built-in webcam is great for Skype and similar video-chat services.
Applications open in seconds and there are no lags, hiccups or awkward moments when you wonder whether your computer is out for tea.
It was very easy to just pick up and use-- It did not take long to get used to the Mac OS.
I had it four months when my disc drive refused to open.
And the ram (the thing that makes it faster) comes sporting 2 gigs for high performance to handle more stuff at once and surf the web a whole lot faster than before.
I have had another Mac, but it got slow due to an older operating system.
BUT there's this application called Boot Camp which allows you to add another OS X like Windows.
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst i've ever seen.
I needed a driver for my HP and they would not help me with out me paying over $50 for it.
also you may need to charge it once a day, if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac  the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it.
The 13" Macbook Pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to CA this is the best price we can get for a great product.
I took off a star because the machine has a lot of junk software on it.
Love the stability of the Mac software and operating system.
I reloaded with Windows 7 Ultimate, and the Bluetooth and Fingerprint reader (software) would not load.
The Aspire wont even boot past the Acer screen with a Droid (I have tried both Motorola and HTC) plugged into the USB port.
There are several programs for school or office use (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.), music (Garageband), photo management (Photo Booth, iPhoto), video-editing or movie-making (iMovie), etc.
This is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components, and I'm hoping that it can be fixed with a ground loop isolator, but I still expected better product quality for this price range.
In addition, all the design tools on Pages and Keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations.
(The SATA controller is the motherboard chip that lets the CPU talk to the hard drive.)
I've been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such a small amount of memory.
After replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working  (3 months of use) which was frustrating.
I like those programs better than Office and you can save your files to be completely compatible with the Office programs as well.
defective software.
This just keeps having it's hard drive replaced!
Have not yet needed any customer support with this yet so to me that is a great thing, which is leaps and bounds ahead of PC in my opinion.
I had purchased it from a major electronics store and took it to their service department to find out what the problem was.
while about 8 years ago, I hope that the quality has changed.
The processor a AMD Semprom at 2.1 ghz is a bummer it does not have the power for HD or heavy computing.
The next time I had an issue my lightscribe wouldn't work.
The dv4 boasted a faster processor, more memory, and a bigger hard drive than my old computer, plus a better quality web cam, nicer screen, and many other features.
It really is perfect for work and play.
Delivery was early too.
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking a switch.
The feature are good enough for what I need.
I got assurances from 2 different people that the remaining 10 months of my warranty would transfer to the new computer.
Great product, very easy to use and great graphics.
Now when I order I did not go full scale for the webcam or full keyboard I wanted something for basics of being easy to carry when I use crutchs or wheelchair and with a backpack laptop bag.
-Computer crashed frequently and battery life decreased very quickly.
It also does not have bluetooth.
After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs (delivery service was slow, and without the laptop I had no access to the internet, and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again), it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years.
It was still working, but there was nothing on the screen.
Size: I know 13 is small (especially for a desktop replacement) but with an external monitor, who cares.
also you may need to charge it once a day, if for medium use every thing fast and easy with mac  the size and look is the most feature that attracted me to it.
1.You can not change your desktop background (window's 7 starter does NOT support that function).
The battery holds up well, it's built very solidly, and runs fast.
It's just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open.
I feel that it was poorly put together, because once in a while different plasticÂ piecesÂ would come off of it.
Fan noise: The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background.
So having the AC plug go out on me and get lose or I could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good.
I think that if it is the motherboard again so soon that they should replace it.
Cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones/mic plus network connection on left make for a very messy setup with cords going every direction.
Laptop was in new condition and operational, but for the audio problem when 1st sent for repair.
Awesome graphics!
It even has a great webcam, and Skype works very well.
super fast processor and really nice graphics card..
Was not happy with one of the programs on it.
Laptop is advertised as a 15" but the casing looks like that of a 17".
but now i have realized its a problem with this brand.
First things first, Macbook pro has many applications to make life easier, unlike the windows computers.
my niece and nephew have played a few web games and it runs anything that doesn't require a dedicated video card.
when i called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is 23 twenty three days from the date of purchase.
So, I took it back to the apple store and they narcissist genius bar staff) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.
I couldn't believe how long the battery lasted on a single charge.
System is loosing about 20% of performance because of that.
I could not find a phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat.
you can find many laptops with the same performance and even better with lower price, but you cannot find the look, easy, applications, and the experience in mac.
A seventy dollar mouse!
I am forever changed and will no longer buy a Windows based machine for personal use.
I did not have to call the support line at all.
The Macbook arrived in a nice twin packing and sealed in the box, all the functions works great.
Because he said that the hinge is under the motherboard and they have to dismantle the whole thing before it can be tightened.
I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the hard drive and mother board yet again.
The other lock-up problems are from a myriad of causes, the most common being a corrupted version of Appleworks which can render the browser useless.
After purchasing this thing, I find out that I need a special interface device to connect my camera, and that it cannot be purchased at the store - only on line.
Then, within 5 months, the charger crapped out on me.
The performance is awesome.
Overall the computer is very easy to use, the screen is perfect, great computer, my daughter loves.
Just a black screen!
this computer will last you at least 7 years, thats an amazing life spanned an electronic.
I even got my teenage son one, because of the features that it offers, like, iChat, Photobooth, garage band and more!
I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run Windows 7 on it by using the VMWare program.
First the screen goes completely out.
Second HDD cover has walls inside that need to be broken if you what to install one.
I was sorly disapointed to discover that HP (what I thought was a reputable company) wouldn't honor the warrenty when the fan blade fell apart.
Even with virus protection, it always turned off when updates were needed and installed.
The best thing to do is build your own computer, but if u can't company's like dell who allow you to choose the components are better and for the same price you can get a computer who compares to one of apple $2000 systems and if you google "dell coupons" you can find codes that take a signifantÂ  amount off the price.
The AMD Turin processor seems to always perform so much better than Intel.
None of the techs at HP knew what they were doing.
I had 3 months when the ports started going out.
The best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features.
Keyboard could use some trimming.
Then it ceased charging at all.
It has just enough RAM to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs.
The apple care has never failed me, and I expect it to be the same for this computer as well.
I love its solid build, light wt and excellent battery life (for now).
I paid for extra memory and the 17-inch screen, as well as the top of the line DVD and CD burners.
I would  rather spend my money on a computer that costs more then a Toshiba that  isn't good at all.
I have no idea how this could have even gotten past quality control during production.
It was secure and easy to navigate.
There are several programs for school or office use (Pages, Numbers, Keynote, etc.), music (Garageband), photo management (Photo Booth, iPhoto), video-editing or movie-making (iMovie), etc.
