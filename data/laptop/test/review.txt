Boot time is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute.
tech support would not fix the problem unless I bought your plan for $150 plus.
Set up was easy.
Did not enjoy the new Windows 8 and touchscreen functions.

Other than not being a fan of click pads (industry standard these days) and the lousy internal speakers, it's hard for me to find things about this notebook I don't like, especially considering the $350 price tag.

The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key.
Made interneting (part of my business) very difficult to maintain.
Luckily, for all of us contemplating the decision, the Mac Mini is priced just right.
Super light, super sexy and everything just works.
Only problem that I had was that the track pad was not very good for me, I only had a problem once or twice with it, But probably my computer was a bit defective.
It is super fast and has outstanding graphics.
But the mountain lion is just too slow.
Strong build though which really adds to its durability.

The battery life is excellent- 6-7 hours without charging.
I've had my computer for 2 weeks already and it works perfectly.

I was extremely happy with the OS itself.
The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months.
The criticism has waned, and now I'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing.
I would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had Windows 8
MS Office 2011 for Mac is wonderful, well worth it.
But the performance of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment.
They don't just look good; they deliver excellent performance.

It's light and easy to transport.
Once you get past learning how to use the poorly designed Windows 8 Set-Up you may feel frustrated.
It's been time for a new laptop, and the only debate was which size of the Mac laptops, and whether to spring for the retina display.

I wanted it for it's mobility and man, this little bad boy is very nice.
I found the mini to be:Exceptionally easy to set up
Having USB3 is why I bought this Mini.
The sound is nice and loud; I don't have any problems with hearing anything.
It is very slim, the track pad is very much impressed with me.
The settings are not user-friendly either.
Thank goodness for OpenOffice!

Yes, that's a good thing, but it's made from aluminum that scratches easily.
Quick and has built in virus control.
Took a long time trying to decide between one with retina display and one without.
I was also informed that the components of the Mac Book were dirty.
the hardware problems have been so bad, i can't wait till it completely dies in 3 years, TOPS!

Can you buy any laptop that matches the quality of a MacBook?
It feels cheap, the keyboard is not very sensitive.
Though please note that sometimes it crashes, and the sound quality isnt superb.
It is very easy to navigate even for a novice.
Does everything I need it to, has a wonderful battery life and I couldn't be happier.

I Have been a Pc user for a very long time now but I will get used to this new OS.
One more thing, this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC's, also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables.

I wanted a computer that was quite, fast, and that had overall great performance.
Apple "Help" is a mixed bag.
It suddenly can not work.
Harddrive was in poor condition, had to replace it.
The on/off switch is a bit obscure in the rear corner.
My only complaint is the total lack of instructions that come with the mac mini.
The only task that this computer would not be good enough for would be gaming, otherwise the integrated Intel 4000 graphics work well for other tasks.

It is robust, with a friendly use as all Apple products.
It is fast and easy to use.
And the fact that it comes with an i5 processor definitely speeds things up
I have been PC for years but this computer is intuitive and its built in features are a great help

My last laptop was a 17" ASUS gaming machine, which performed admirably, but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life, I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome, not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago.
However, it did not have any scratches, ZERO battery cycle count (pretty surprised), and all the hardware seemed to be working perfectly.

This one still has the CD slot.
No HDMI port.
I had to install Mountain Lion and it took a good two hours.

I switched to this because I wanted something different, even though I miss windows.
Apple no longer includes iDVD with the computer and furthermore, Apple doesn't even offer it anymore!
I also wanted Windows 7, which this one has.
