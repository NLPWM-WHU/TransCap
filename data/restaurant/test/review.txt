Certainly not the best sushi in New York, however, it is always fresh, and the place is very clean, sterile.

I'm looking forward to going back soon and eventually trying most everything on the menu!
I just had my first visit to this place and can't wait to go back and slowly work my way through the menu.
I asked repeatedly what the status of the meal was and was pretty much grunted at by the unbelievably rude waiter.

Although the restaurant itself is nice, I prefer not to go for the food.
