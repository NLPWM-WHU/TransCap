thank god donald j. trump didn't appoint dr. ben carson to surgeon general!
ben carson and sheriff clark are two men who know that trump isn't racist. truly great americans. unbelievably talented role models for all.
ben carson will be awesome with hud, word is he plays a lot of simcity
new! #rightstylemag issue 1! fashion done right! richard spencer! ben carson! dabiq chic! guyliner! enjoy & share!!
pres. trump, work with ben carson.  he is smart, a man of god, wise, faithful, loyal, not arrogant, honest.  he is wise council.
@realdonaldtrump. absolutely ben carson, we love him.
@realdonaldtrump yes. mr. ben carson will be a great help.go for it.
perfect!  jeeze🙄
if president elect trump does not want our rudy than he should chose the smart dr.ben  carson as his sos. he is scandal free and good man

grayson allen is good. i think he can pay next level. 2nd round.
we need to start talking more about how grayson allen can play point guard in the nba. such a terrific and willing passer
i never thought i would say this but grayson allen is very close to surpassing jj redick as my favorite blue devil of all time.
grayson allen with five points and a really nice assist over the final 2:40 and duke leads william & mary 46-30 at the half.
cameron crazie in duke's halftime contest wearing a no. 3 duke jersey with "allen" on the back. hope grayson's making something off that.
12, 4 and 3 to grayson allen at the half. still not 100% but that’s a decent first half.
grayson allen & luke kennard carry this team, but more importantly, they carry eachother. they are the keys to this team.
@joey_judge he is ... grayson allen is just better
seriously love grayson allen the most!!! raining 3's in cameron tonight fam!!!
i'm just happy grayson allen's playing. 💙💙💙
a travel call on grayson allen. someplace, somewhere, tony bennett smiles.
i'm thankful for grayson allen as well
luke kennard done turned into our best player. he's having that last season grayson allen breakout
grayson to allen. pure beauty!
grayson allen is so cute 😭😭😭
all i want for christmas is grayson allen!!!! 💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙💙
so, if that were grayson allen on the floor he would've tripped someone lol!
@themag_24 @devon_stone8 @unc_tarheelfan yeah grayson allen. 17 points vs w&m
grayson allen is something serious 💪🏀
i liked a @youtube video from @dukeblueplanet  dbp: matt jones with grayson allen after the william & mary win
@harrydacreator they have esperienced talent and big time freshman.  grayson allen , kennard jones and jefferson with stud freshman
i'm glad i can finally agree with @sethdavishoops, the duke and grayson allen apologist, on something. happy thanks…
god bless him—he’s a stud—coach k on grayson allen, who had 17, 5 and 6:
grayson allen & lonzo ball the best players in college basketball.
i'm thankful for my family,my friends,basketball, red hair dye, and grayson allen.

@madjewesswoman @putinrf_eng he's a powerful force. we in the us (except obama admin) love him.
which is why this president deserved to be hers. she carried weight for the clinton admin., weight for the obama admin., and it was her turn
yes, raul castro is still in charge, but he's been warming up to the obama admin's offerings of normalcy in relations.
@bahamiangalpyt and if the healthcare plan change,seems he will keep the best part from obamacare.
@gas8128 because of obamacare my mother was able to have health insurance for the first time in about 15 years.

but for us democrats, obamacare is a badge of honor. because no ... #kathleensebelius #aphorism

i'm not even catholic, but pope francis is my dude. like i just need him to hug me and tell me everything is okay.
prophesized collapse of organized religion in society? we can only hope. they think francis will be the last pope. he's a hard act to follow
got a rare chance to see #pope_francis in person @ vatican city!!! — feeling blessed in st. peter's basilica
@tonyfernandes god bless you & pope francis abundantly
happy birthday pope francis! "christos" 12/17/2016 @news_va_en @vatican_va_en @pontifex @lanouvelleeve #80
catholics, pull yourselves together, show loyalty to pope francis... successor of st peter « protect the pope
great speech by pope francis. he said "the church needs mercy pastors who don't lower the standards"!

@lookinabout yet we won the popular vote we already out number u. and we are slowly expanding into the rural/suburban area
@tuckercarlson love your new show, well deserved. quick ? can anyone find the popular vote button when they vote for potus? #trumpwon. #maga
@roadrunneri80 nope! hrc won popular vote by a landslide and still counting! she is the people's president! 1 vote=1 vote! #stillwithher

@trump2045896984 @nelsonvelazquez clinton is ahead over 2 million in popular vote.
@foxnews @geraldorivera @foxnewsinsider newsflash: the democratic party won the popular vote by a landslide.
@pedos4muhammad lol muh popular vote. 😂😂😂
it's amazing that clinton will still win the popular vote by 2m votes considering what the fbi/kgb and wikileaks did to lose her the race.
@adic33 and... i voted for gore!  we need to bring back the popular vote!
.@aphclarkson more realistic version: trump: putin is a great guy. poroshenko: i totally agree! trump: that was a joke, dumb boy.

dierks bentley and eric church at @countryconcert! happy 22nd birthday to me! is it july yet?
murray has given it his all, which wasn't expected after the last few days he has had but federer just unbreakable. tb 2nd set. #cincytennis
federer stays winning. into the finals tomorrow.
federer beats murray 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach #cincytennis final. he'll be going for his 7th title vs novak djokovic, who is going for his first
way to go roger. old man federer just keeps rolling along. #djokernole v. #fed for the final tomorrow. #cincytennis
djokovic v federer should be good one tomorrow. fancy the swiss, can't see djokovic coming back if he falls behind in this one.
federer will play another final tomorrow. this guy is just amazing. #cincytennis
excited for the federer vs. djokovic final in cincinnati tomorrow afternoon. should be some great tennis!
serena punches her ticket to the finals in straight sets. joins djokovic and federer in tomorrow's #cincytennis singles finals. decent trio.
love this new trick that federer has when he is facing a 2nd serve. running up to the serve line and taking it early is unreal!
some outrageous shots from federer in the tiebreak. the clean half volley return of a djokovic 2nd serve just about the best of them.
federer breaks early in the 2nd set! even consolidates the break! up 3-0! #rf #tennis #cincytennis
federer's a man with a mission... 7th one coming.. #cincytennis
tiger, federer, serena, the niners (eesh about those guys), and some cold tx brews. laaazzzy birthday sunday.
for the 1st time, federer has beaten no.1 and no.2 players in the atp rankings in consecutive matches en route to a title. #cincytennis
federer is my 2nd fave male tennis player of all time right after the great arthur ashe.
what a great day for world sport: usain got his 9th gold, federer claimed cincinnati title no 7 and i pumped some weights. #truepro
new @tennispodcast tomorrow, reviewing federer, serena and the pre us open storylines. this is what we sound like
add to the results, federer over djokovic  and lewis hamilton, and it's not a bad sunday at all!
23rd of august was such a nice day, england lift ashes, bolt won 100 m and federer beats djokovic in cincinati.
"papa you need a hat" thus said one of federer's twin girls.......congrats again for winning cinci for the 7th time @rogerfederer
federer overtakes lendl for second longest streak of being seeded at the us open in the open era. 15th straight year. connors leads with 18.
@vivi_rfobsessed looks clear cut for federer though. but 3 sets may be a critical   variable when he plays against stan or murray
all though federer will probably obliterate the 4th quarter i think gasquet 200/1 looks big #usopen
@livetennis i believe federer has a good chance of winning the title for the 6th time but he needs to hold his composer against djokovic!
federer is looking good after winning cincy for the 7th time.
federer back for 16th us open: federer hopes his us open first-round encounter against the argentine goes much...
you'll love this. @fedfantejal #blastfromthepast, federer, murray, serena, djokovic. its got it all. #worththeread
tennis-tough tests from the start for federer, murray: new york, aug 30 (reuters) - roger federer and andy mur...
@tsextratime @benrothenberg novak is surely the man to beat. federer or murray may run him to the base line. the usual suspects.
i believe #rafa could win a 3rd #usopen title if he can make it to the semifinals at least because of federer, murray, etc. #usopenworld
@oreillyfactor @realdonaldtrump @thepeople4trump @mikecahall1  the u.s. open is rockin..nadal tonite, federer tomorrow
how to watch federer and murray on tuesday at the 2015 us open: roger federer will begin his 2015 us open on t...
@jim_hulbert federer faced the highest ranked guy in r1. his draw is tricky. so is murray's.if fed reaches the qfs, then he may meet berdy.
i'll go to the office 2h hour earlier and watch federer's game tomorrow!
yes, federer's attacking return is brilliant.  but yes, it's a play club players can do too, esp. off weak and predictable 2nd serves
not going to be able to watch federer's match vs darcis but expect to wake up tomorrow to read of a comprehensive victory for the swiss.
@camerondallas federer is about to begin his 2nd round. go watch it.
darcis stops the bleeding by winning his 1st game since 1-0 in the first serve. well, one kind of bleeding because federer's still leading.
federer is about to be done with his match in the same time the 5th set of the hewitt vs. tomic match takes!
jo konta's win over muguruza was the longest ever women's #usopen match &amp; the 1st set alone lasted as long as federer's entire match! woah!
federer defeats darcis 6-1 6-2 6-1 to advance to 3rd round at the @usopen accomplishing a perfect 16-0 in 2nd round
last year, majority of the federer matches took place primetime.  this year, it's the other way around.  2nd on ashe tomorrow
@sjauhar i keep trying to book as soon as i learn when federer's playing - too late. nosebleed seats for 4th round (!) going at $250.
the 1st week of the 2015 #usopen is almost up &amp; the big names of serena, venus, djokovic, murray, federer &amp; wawrinka are still in the draw.
@mmunro91 i may have never seen a player play a higher tennis level than i just saw, nadal, federer and djokovic included. make no mistake,
fognini is i believe only the 3rd one to beat nadal 3 or more times in a year - the others (no points for guessing) federer and djokovic.
federer breaks the kohlschreiber serve!! federer is on red hot form &amp; doesnt look like stopping. fed leads 2-0 in the 1st set #usopen
good starts for federer and stosur. berdych level at 1-1 after winning the 2nd set!
wow, tragic start from federer in the 3rd
just like in the 2nd, federer breaks back.
roger while having trouble with serve, he is still through to 4th round! federer might face isner in 4th round
@johnisner i concur with your coach. its you! #amextennis good luck tomorrow against federer!
federer defeats kohlschreiber 6-3 6-4 6-4 to go through to the 4th round @usopen
federer advances into fourth round at us open: in the blazing new york sun, federer seems to be in his element...
@rosequartz0518 @_claudiaw beep beep...! yep, murray and federer into the top 16. phew! :) see you tomorrow!
monday at the us open: murray, federer &amp; konta are all in action at flushing meadows today
federer's second serve placement is awesome. that's why he's the best server ever. nobody has better placement on 1st or 2nd serve
gonna have to dvr this isner and federer match... this thing is good. getting ready to head to a tiebreaker in the 1st set. #usopen2015
federer saved 4 bp (from 0/40) and holds for 2-2 in the 2nd set.
ok time to check back in with tennis - isner and federer heading into a 2nd tiebreak
federer just ended the 2nd set with a couple of ridiculously good shots.
federer rebounds from 3-5 down in the 2nd set tb to take it 8-6. leads isner. 7-6(0) 7-6(6) #usopen
i watched federer calmly destroy a dude at the us open on thursday, and it was amazing. i still thought "you're not sick of this dude yet?"
i believe the loss at rg to wawrinka was first time in a decade federer didn't break once in a gs match. this might be the 2nd. #usopen2015
that ending of 2nd set tb by federer, he really is the original son of jor-el
wow, federer wastes 3 bps with 3 isner's 2nd serves. fed 0/8 on bps tonight
federer's 1st serve is just...perfect. #usopen
federer just won his 15th straight point on his serve... lol wow
@nerdistmom it's weird that in the 1st set federer &amp; isner went game for game until the tiebreak. then federer trucked him in the tiebreak
federer breaks his own record with a 14th appearance at the atp finals after reaching the us qf #finalshowdown
with his consistency in playing great tennis, i am sure federer will crush gasquet in the qf. c'mon federer!!
.@richardgasquet1 honing his game on p3 court for his match with federer tomorrow. #usopen
"federer plays tomorrow, so i guess i won't talk to you until thursday because you'll be busy drooling" #shitmymomsays #tiff

@johnc1908 i pretty sure none of those fans regret not being there to see harper strike out in the 9th on a pitch in the dirt.
i don't much like harper but he is right to do this.
sherman or harper: who knows the strike zone better? my column:

@korycpc telling why you should trust harper. worth the 10 min. to listen. not after eating, though.#cdnpoli  #cdnpoli
@southpawslinger @jonmorosi @foxsports @fs1 but he's certainly been the 1st or 2nd best player in the nl overall, harper and kershaw better.
@redporchreport harper putting up historic numbers. thus far it's been a series to forget at the plate, but, again, he didn't pitch the 7th.
@evanlsolomon harper gets first chance, most seats won get 2nd chance. easy. harper does not play well with others, ask danny williams.
@ian_wayne @p_wog   keep focus on harper&amp; all these good things will be added unto you may the best man who wins the heart of canadians

sitting in my office, window open, sun shining in, listening to my ipod, wondering exactly what the catch is with this job.
1 gud thing about losing my phone is that it made me use my ipod which has all the songs i used listen to in 3rd year
i drenched the old ipod nano (6th gen) in isopropanol and it actually worked! the screen will never look the same but totally worth it.
found my old ipod from like 7th grade and am now realizing i listened to some hood tunes for just a kid!!
i got a new ipod today! hooray! the 6th gen (gold) and ordered my case just now.my life is complete!

i'm not taking my ipod to school tomorrow because i want to have a battery when i go to my concert
@amitbhawani @geekyranjit  ...what are your thoughts about apple's ipod touch 6th gen?
@jroberts332 @jobot935 [2/2] that's why my prog/indie/heavy rock-filled ipod has one direction's 3rd and 4th albums on it. i am not kidding.

#ff @innocent - not just for the drinks but for jay-z's 99 problems! 99 problems that we may just ponder about at some point in our lives!
sitting at a curb staring at the white house listening to jay-z.thats a fine friday
for those who may not know, jay-z wrote the verses for still d.r.e but he's never disrespected dre or ever spoken about ghostwriting.
december 4th only cause i used the beginning in my jay-z speech for class
was hoping this would escalate to be something like nas vs jay-z but meek got ko'ed in the 2nd round lol
[#new] video: casey veggies talks first meeting with jay-z at 17 years old, working hard to inspire the youth  dec 15,
meek drooped like a jay-z album the 2nd &amp; 3rd time you hear it. you will understand it and fall in love with it
i was in like the 4th, 5th, 6th grade burning cds and mixtapes that faithfully consisted of dipset, old bone thugs, and hella jay-z
jay-z may not be the best looking guy, but he proves to others that looks aren't everything
roadblock: in the immortal words of jay-z: "whatever deity may guide my life, dear lord don't let me die tonight....
"jay-z stole all his music in reasonable doubt."  that may be true, but he stole some timeless, genius shit
crazy in love by beyonce feat. jay-z was no.2 in the uk charts on 2 august 2003
would be crazy if dr. dre, eminem, jay-z all show up at @drake's #ovofest tomorrow. tonight it's @yg @bigsean @jeremih @cody_macc @omen #ovo
my following may not be as big as jay-z's but i got a solid supportive growing following. thanks for the love. #teamm00y0u
the 1st dance at my wedding will actually just be a duet of diamonds from sierra leone-remix with my husband as jay-z and myself as kanye.
aye now meek may surprise us. you know when jay-z dropped takeover they thought it was over for nas. and then ether......
may the best of your today be the worse off your tomorrow - jay-z
#weho: @chrispipkinsc is leading the pack for a the carters: lil wayne, beyonce, and jay-z ride thursday at 5:30pm! grab a bike!
imagine if ether had dropped in the social media age. we may not have the same respect we do for jay-z today.
i know it's old, but the beatles, jay-z, danger mouse -- c'mon... classic mix --...
i grew up to this song..didn't knew the 2nd verse is about beyonce..until now.jay-z - lost one ft. chrisette michele
the sun, earth, the lakers, jay-z, oprah, and 5 whoppers
prince confirmed that he and jay-z will release an album september 7. #paisleypark  #minneapolis
st james park randomly playing the instrumental for my 1st song by jay-z at half time?  decent.
talib, jay-z, kanye, t.i, big pooh, dela, j dilla, nas, pete rock, 9th wonder and the legendary slum village.
personally handing jay-z jerseys may be the highlight of my new york existence. first time i've been star struck.
from now on i'll try to be more sympathetic towards freemasons like jay-z. when you come from nothing european culture may look like heaven.
jay-z and beyonce came to taylor's 25th but not kim and kanye's wedding. imma let taylor finish, but she had the best birthday of all time.
#fridayfun! jay-z's got that friday feeling -   have you?
who belong in the 3rd spot for top 3 of all time. jay-z, nas or eminem?
make a lasting impression on the first day of class tomorrow: walk in with a boom box blaring public service announcement by jay-z
enjoying how the jay-z vs. abdel halim hafez lawsuit forces serious newspapers to put "big pimpin'" in headlines.
when you realize classes start the 9th so the ac/dc concert will be the best concert since eminem and jay-z #thatwasgoat
sept 11, 2001-  good: jay-z drops the best rap album of the decade (the blueprint)  bad: world trade center gets destroyed   #mindblown
dreamed i was @beyonce and i spent the night making out with jay-z at a lower east side rooftop party until the sun came up.
my nigga @lightshow10thpl sat down with jay-z's right hand man on a rooftop in the city. i'm rootin' for youngin'. straight up!
"the best part of living in new york is the nightlife. the 2nd best part is knowing that jay-z and beyonce share the same weather as me."
@seaglass4nicole today was a jay-z type of the day. who knows what tomorrow will bring?
@jkailli although you may know this better than i do since you're from california lol i'm not knocking jay-z view in black culture, i say
"we make a million of beats, cause our stories is deep. and fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet." - jay-z
only looking forward to kanye's performance at the vma's tomorrow! heard he's bringing out rih, bey, jay-z &amp; paul mccarthy
i was certainly not expecting @jcolenc to bring @drake and jay-z to the ville.  i may have dropped a tear or two.  greatest show ever!
if kanye became president, folk that wrote off the masonic/illuminati symbols in he and jay-z's music/vids as meaningless, may think again!
today during 6th it was dead silent in the library &amp; all of a sudden my ipad started blasting jay-z's voice saying "motherfucker i got this"
also the correct top 5 is eminem, jay-z, 2pac, the notorious b.i.g., and ice cube in that order with big pun as the 6th man
jay-z sat in that interview like a god showing that he was truly ahead of his time while the other niggas flirting with foxy brown
i knew jay-z was getting old but i forgot about eminem. he looks 30 something!
@mariongr hey honey may i have a coffe cup with that song? jay-z - can i get a...
@mstoscimarie not really and i'm a huge jay-z fan. but, when march 9th come around? biggie all day everyday
happy bday to the amazing @beyonce #beyday big love to you, jay-z and blue ivy. may ur family continue to amaze this world. loves x
the game 1st album 1 song he say he rap like eazy-e then nas then 50 cent then dr dre then jay-z then eazy-e again then like his dead bro
may have smoked a blunt with jay-z at the @bassnectar show last nigh trying to remember..no big deal but i want his connect shits fire !!!
may the lord give you jay-z and beyonce's kinda love... no way that relationship is fake or for social media
the day jay-z comes to s.a i'll be the 1st person to cue  at the computicket  i love that man

12:26am and we've got us open drama, colbert's debut, and messi just scored a sick goal for argentina.  all live/1st run now.
and that is why messi is the best in the world. good game though. now to wait till october 10.
and argentina say messi does nothing for the national team??! that goal was just magical messi time as usual, c'mon! xd
very proud of that 2nd goal from mexico! even tho they didn't win (nothing new) props to messi for the last min goal
proud!! masche &amp; messi scored, neymar &amp; rafi scored (tue.), alba and iniesta (sat.) &amp; were the only goalscorers in these games. #interlands
messi has registered back-to-back hat-tricks (3+ goals) for barcelona for the 3rd time in his career
@fraudiesta i agree with messi being 3rd but my top 3 would be:  1.hazard 2.suarez 3.messi
but messi made the former premier league champions look like a group of 11 lads at goals
today is metlife. jesus is coming back its the 2nd easter. all wars have ended &amp; ceased fire in the stadium. we all gained superpowers.

"@tomlennon @iamsteadman @probablydrunk i'm a dumb, the missus booked a sofa at the electric tomorrow for ant-man. fancy it tomorrow?"

"so my crush's girlfriend is dragging him along to see paper towns tomorrow, coincidentally a film i want to see"
ice cube son and @dcyoungfly to do an our generation friday would be the dopest thing ever!!!

"fyi, tomorrow = release date for the pumpkinnnn!!! just called my local dunkin. can you say fiend?!"
it would have been cool if ice cube was staring out of the window at his neighbor when they showed him writing friday. #heymissparker
straight outta compton's success hopefully convinces new line cinema to give ice cube the right budget for the last friday movie.

@minnman47 @pjmedia_com with direct ties to #hamas & #muslimbrotherhood the dems are finished if they elect this terrorist
#islam is a ideology, theology, and psychology of terrorism, hypocrisy and deceit. #islamic #palestine #isis #hamas

the decision to recount votes in wisconsin is a joke. leftists are still spotting-the-dummy of their loss. #trumptransition
@n8tivedreamr ah yes, another liberal buzzphrase that is moronic. leftists are always looking for an avenue of victimhood.
@struggle_sesh you'd be suprised. leftists don't really care about reality.
@joshbutler lies. ignore all the unionists and other leftists pushing pedophilia as a non-crime. #evil

#demonetisation was the favourite of leftists and socialists once upon a time. amusing to see the boot on the right side.
@anthonyrolles @riogallica @blackknight981 @margi1959 @koalamoon2 the leftists flock like sheep. not an individual thinker amongst them.
leftists don't get to complain about the way #white ppl respond to #antiwhite harassment /attacks ! they should have stopped long ago! #maga
obviously that was dumb bc now that the time is nigh, i remember that most leftists are wimps & we don't have strong unions or commie party

@dhiggins63 @realdonaldtrump @sanjean823 leftists have cried wolf a few too many times, while trump supporters r getting assaulted actually.

mn most liberal state in us thanks to twin cities migrants & leftists. look at report on mn decriminalizing child sex abuse it's sickening!😡
and both liberals and leftists can whine about "bathroom politics" for slightly different but related reasons.
@fashnova your keenness to brand all 'leftists' as a think-alike monoblock belies your claim to understand plight of each individual.
liberals will make the snl argument of "it made clinton unelectable!" leftists might say it's neoliberal individualism gone mad.

the us public essentially decided an election based on amplified lies and suppressed truths--and some people want a direct popular vote!
@moekamerow @huffingtonpost hilllary won the popular vote, you stole our election
@foxnews @kellyannepolls while their at it they throw out all the illegal votes so we don't have to hear how she won the popular vote
trump did not win the popular vote. i expect there to be proof to a scientific certainty that our election was tampered with.

congratulations mr.trump, you just lost the popular vote by over 2,000,000.

the popular vote has never mattered it's a lie. look at the election of 1824

no, it does not. popular vote does not count doofus. @rweingarten @hillaryclinton
this was just revealed about hillary’s so-called ‘popular vote win’, she’s busted!

@vaccinexchange there isn't even a proper correlation because almost all of the decline in deaths&complications occurred before the vaccines

how do people believe vaccines cause autism, the world is flat , chem trails and all that nonsense i'm genuinely curious .
vaccines contains mercury.. i will not fuck up my potential childrens life with an excessive amount of chemicals
toddler boy erroneously given an excessive dose of gardasil - may be at risk of neurological damage
between 1954 and 1963, close to 98 million americans received polio vaccines contaminated w/ a carcinogenic monkey virus, known as sv40.
although some vaccines protect our children, they still have potential to b very toxic.
why are oral vaccines less common than injected vaccines even if it can induce both systemic and mucosal immunities?
@dcexaminer hop @realdonaldtrump will also nullify mandatory slew of vaccines required in ca, enough to kill a horse! autism is rampant.

vaccines should not be legally required especially when doctors cannot predict ahead of time who will be harmed
@amosyee true. but there's a question that still needs to be answered: what if autism causes vaccines?
@vaxcalc only the nazi leftists want to force vaccines on people.
instead of studying i looked into vegetarianism and realized i'm a horrible vegetarian and feel like there's no point now. 😭

@burninglisa omg i can't use my credit card reward points on preorders and it's not available on amazon until the 18th -_- can u wait?
amazon's refusal to integrate nicely with the android ecosystem may have been its undoing in the fire phone market.
author: if i've ever reviewed your book, grab a screen cap now! amazon may pull it down.
my amazon package was supposed to be delivered today by 8pm. guess that means i'll get it tomorrow before 8pm?
damnit amazon! when you say you're going to ship something on the 8th, i expect it to ship on the 8th!
@amazonhelp you may please check my pending complaint with amazon for which i write many emails and called customer care.
@monomirror jelly. mine won't be here until friday because amazon are tight with shipping dates :(.

i'm bummed with amazon prime right now. i ordered something and it was supposed to be delivered today, but it wasn't and i leave tomorrow :(
@jonk i've had several problems with amazon prime - customer service has been a nightmare especially if your items are from 3rd party vendor
i'm kind of confused why my amazon prime stuff that shipped today isn't coming until the 19th-24th. that's certainly not two days.
"arriving tuesday" is decidedly the least prime my amazon prime shipping has ever been. wha happen?
because the answer is wednesday and that is very soon and i'm still not packed (also my amazon prime order didn't arrive today wtf)
the one time we want to use the amazon prime streaming and it's down... grrr ruined my sunday night! @amazonuk
such a retard! somehow managed to get another trial for amazon prime and i've forgot to cancel it for a 2nd time
great, my cables have now been bumped from being delivered today to friday. thanks amazon prime, really feeling the worth here.
ordered 3 amazon prime items yesterday. one will arrive saturday (2 days!), another sunday (3 days?), the third on tuesday (5 days???).
yeah, i know it's sunday delivery &amp; whatnot - and who else does that?! - but my amazon prime package is 3 and a half hours late... so far...
amazon prime is a lie. it said my stuff would be delivered by monday. its wednesday, and still hasn't arrived. tracking doesn't make sense.
finally broke down and got amazon prime and the delivery on my 1st purchase as a member is late. @amazon i was expecting better.
aftr network drop amazon prime streaming deal for 2 more years make the show unsignable for 3rd season by anybdy but amazon.
amazon prime fucks me off so much, like you get really into something and then after like the 3rd season you have to pay. fuck off.
yes that's right @bbc close down your best channel why don't you? you're not meant to be netflix or amazon prime.
amazon prime is literally a lie....i ordered a book last monday &amp; it still isn't here. do better @amazon
amazon prime day is just like black friday if you only buy bulk protein powder and will-making software on black friday.
i was really excited for the amazon prime day sale, but everything is garbage. better than black friday my butt!

amazon prime day its better than black friday if you are into buying useless crap. this "sale" isn't worth having prime at all.
is it me ... or is the amazon prime day ... sucks . i have yet to find a great better than black friday deal! damn i was excited too!
this amazon prime day thing is just like black friday, if you ignore the part where amazon didn't put anything you want to buy on sale.
is it just me, or is amazon prime day less black friday and more your weird neighbor's garage sale?
"amazon prime day will be like black friday!" i guess because i'm just as disappointed?

where i truly believe amazon failed for their amazon prime day sale.... the moment they claimed it'd have "bigger deals than black friday"

well amazon prime day kind of sucked, didn't it? i was hoping for much more. "bigger than black friday," huh?
so amazon prime day got rained out right? cause there's no way those deals rival black friday deals. when's the rain date?

amazon prime day is like going on the 3rd date with a gal, and when you finally get her panties off she got a dick!
if amazon prime day is "better than black friday" then i'm going to sleep in!  should have been called amazon garage sale day!
after witnessing it, i now realize i've seen amazon prime day every saturday for years....we call them "garage sales"
@judgedillard distressed over all the stuff they bought on the 15th--amazon prime day.
i knew black friday. black friday was a friend of mine. and you, amazon prime day, are no black friday.
so it turns out amazon prime day *did* turn out a lot like black friday--overhyped and not worth the time. #bitteroldmantweet
amazon prime day? amazon scam day is more like it. more deals than black friday my ass!
it didn't live up to the "black friday" hype imo --&gt; amazon prime day leads to sales surge and consumer complaints
@amazonhelp ordered pc parts on amazon prime day, one day shipping, haven't received my item yet. it is now monday. very dissatisfied.

i don't agree with germany bailing out greece for the 3rd time.angela merkel is retarded and this new world order is a senseless stupid idea
i'm sure they are changing the species. look at the obamas and angela merkel. planet of the apes...here we come.

@cnni  not to worry, trump won't remember it tomorrow. but think about the ramifications of using this kind of language about angela merkel.
@cobbo3 and what did angela merkel say? she's going for a 4th term. germany is going to the dogs, right?

i should remember that i may not care what apple is announcing,but i do care about massive #sf disruptions like apple @ bill graham. #fb
if it's u2 i'm breaking all my apple devices
i feel like i'll lose whatever "cool person" creds i may have had by saying this, but i honestly don't care about the apple event today.
today's the 9th&amp;i forgot that apple thing now i feel like those fans that wait for something from a band but it's just apple&amp;i won't get it
come on win10 users, just to screw with apple's statistics let's stream their live event from the edge browser :)
oddly the apple event will stream to a edge browser but not to chrome
feels weird watching an apple event with so much suffering going on in syria :-/
i'd call it plugins but apple calls it complications
this is even more depressing than the apple event.
with the news that apple watch sales may not be as healthy as cupertino claims, we look at how the numbers stack up
a crappy cycling app that doesn't even support the apple watch faved this tweet:

@joshmccarthy_ @welbeast lol moyes went from 1st to 7th and lvg went from 7th back to cl and they're the same level? only arsenal fans
@jcuzzy1 @fydsy @footyml @jimfish286 @wolf_ticketslfc our true par is probably 5th behind arsenal. it might not be nice but it's the reality
an amazon delivery on a sunday is as unpredictable as arsenal on transfer deadline day.
@giroudesque gabriel doesn't even make arsenal's 1st team, enough said.
arsene wenger admits arsenal must be "more realistic" about their premier league title chances after losing 2-1 at swansea city on sunday.
@ibster45 even if arsenal admits he's out 6 months, we're not making a major signing in jan... that's if we make any signings at.
first it turns out meek mill is an arsenal fan, now this. i'm finding a new club. this is a barcelona account now.
imagine: arsenal are on the verge of winning the league with their 17yr old, 24 goal, syrian hot-shot, flying.  and he's deported in march.
i love ozil but how on earth is he the 1st choice corner-kick taker for both germany and arsenal? what the hell does he do in training??

@anderjuanderful when managers/players make it a matter of their ego then things always go bad. that's his problem.. 2nd stint at barca e.g
@shehroze_mufc we are 3rd same as bayern after rm and barca. why the fuck are you taking the name of that snake.
i hated tata martino in barca and i can't stand him coaching argentina! even though it's a friendly no reason to play 5 defenders in 1st 45
@jmilam71591 @dccomics  i hate that they have about 3-4 active universes around. also, having to take from batman's villain stable? c'mon.
batman may be running better, but they have force disabled sli on the game. @wbhomeent is a joke!!!
@productoffear_   "arkham knight, sir. i may be new to you but i'm not to then batman. we have something in common. we both want his head."

thank you @rocksteadygames ! instead of beating up bad guys, batman is beating up my ps4. this is the 3rd time your game crashed my ps4.
whatever, batman. you may call it the batcave, but that doesn?t change the fact you still live in your parents? basement.
curled up in bed watching batman cartoons, it's a terrible monday after all.

@bbcr4today oh for goodness sake, bbc seems to want the gov't to allow terrorists free range to attack uk. may bbc hq be the 1st target!
hello, btls.  every single one of you consumes bbc content even indirectly.  stop whining.
honestly, if the bbc, the habourer of the rich and countless pedophiles were to just no longer exist tomorrow, they wouldn't be missed!
@greenslader also the detail that the bbc, reporting the later date on 2 september, simply assumed "us drone strike"
chris alexander's tv meltdown on pnp last wed. made the bbc's front page on-line. he blames media for lack of action on refugees. #cdnpoli
it seems that politicians can use the bbc to issue propaganda but no one else may. the recent marches and...

tomorrow is going to be a peasant-fest. nicholas witchell is going to be swanning about the bbc like a jim fucking white. boak.
what a prime knob cheese sat next to me on the tube talking extra loudly on the phone about a new show he's pitching to the bbc. jog on.

@bbcpolitics more propaganda from the bbc, they promote platforms of dissent, one day they may return to journalism, make the bbc a plc.

"beyonce outperforms mj" michael didn't look like he was trying to get rid of a wedgie while performing, but if you say so, jan.
i just feel like you can't stan for everybody underneath the sun and in the same breath call beyonce overrated. the irony.
i am real mad that the replay of saturday's made in america festival does not include beyonce. unhappy @tidalhifi subscriber!!!

david cameron knew british pilots were using air strikes on syria in july, but now refuses to welcome anymore refugees as he calls for peace
may allah make david cameron the taghoot disabled and give him cancer in his brain. ameen.
we have many young male 3rd world thugs on our streets now. we don't want david cameron to bring in more.
the sun, for people lacking brain cells and david cameron.   pull the trigger
when david cameron wanted military action on syria he may have been supporting is as he was against assad
"david cameron's former adviser charged with child sexual abuse"   #dougrichard #davidcameron
note to ids: david cameron may be your friend, but he is not right, and he's certainly not honourable.
david cameron is a disgusting liar. up to his neck in criminality working with corrupt undercover cops, theresa may covering his back. #gchq
the vile penny pinching tories shame us all: david cameron's limp action on refugees puts britain outside the eu
hope david cameron enjoys his breakfast tomorrow and isn't put off thinking about all the people he starves
another example of david cameron campaigning on one thin and then doing the exact opposite
@callum_th i'm conflicted. i don't particularly like the sun or david cameron but i always enjoy a david bowie pun/reference.
the sentence for inciting violence on the internet is death-by-drone. david cameron just told us so.
david cameron u bloody moron f**k u how dare u kat in so many muslims? what the fuck u think u r?
authoritarian titmouse david cameron uses the same bullshit to justify drone murdering brits. @potus is so proud:
this is aimed @ david cameron - fight me. meet me behind the bike sheds tomorrow @ 3pm sharp. b there or b square
every voter in scotland is being betrayed because david cameron and theresa may make all our msp's job impossible. #gchq #spies #bbcdp #pmqs
pathetic and misleading response by david cameron to @danielzeichner's question on 6th form college funding. he obviously just doesn't care.

#upi turkey's erdogan: peace with kurds "impossible": ed adamczykankara, turkey, july 28 (upi) -- turkish pres...
wait, people are surprised erdogan was covertly riding the isis tiger? that's just dumb.
@kurdistan_dd erdogan is a pure nutcase, we all should've seen this a coming, kick turkey out of nato. may god bless the people of kurdistan
erdogan: peace process with kurdish militants impossible
"erdogan is trying to achieve the result he failed to in the june 7 election in a political coup"
erdogan may be about to take his push for power to a whole new level, and is drawing u.s. and nato into his game
"erdogan is taking #turkey to war to win an election. this may be the biggest miscalculation of his political career"
erdogan allowed isis to build a network of safe houses in turkey. he now may reap the reward.
@abdughenisabit erdogan the son of jews like his grand father mustafa kamal ata turk (may allah curse him)
@rosariodifusco it may be heading this way thanks to erdogan's monumental mistakes
turkey is pretending to fight isis but target kurds! erdogan wants to eliminated them like turkey did with armenians
i noticed erdogan standing in that mosque whilst the rest were kneeling. interesting snapshot is all i'm saying.
to erdogan, the prospect of an independent kurdish state is more frightening than rampaging islamists. #pkk #isis
@durdurulan erdogan cannot be allowed to get away with what he is doing.he lost the june 7th election and now is seeking to undermine it all
@eastmedmonitor @richardcalhoun @hamzaaktan if erdogan still thinks that turkey may join the eu, i think he might be dreaming. won't happen
obama's new book title: "40 years in the lap of erdogan: how i helped islamo-fascists kill innocent people"
not much mention of foreign policy in the gop ad tonight. wonder if any of them even know how to pronounce erdogan?
@dlepeska @timepdc dear david, i hope erdogan's mentors won't translate into the turkish ,otherwise he may use it against egpytian leader :)
@turkeyreport pkk may revoke all plans of erdogan. for example, it can stop killing.
the road to erdogan's new sultanate is paved with blood:

@thansarayli @bojanbb an erdogan hater wouldn't be an akp voter in the 1st place. especially when erdogan is out of the party now.
@cverenkotte erdogan won't appoint kilicdaroglu until saturday. afterwards it will already be too late for a new round of negotiations!
west should be ashamed of alliance with erdogan who from july 24 is exterminating the kurdish people! #kurds #ypg
i'm of the opinion that there may be a military coup in turkey. there are similarities between erdogan &amp; menderes.
erdogan has waged war on the kurds to stir up the nationalist vote for his next snap election in november.  #yoursilenceiskillingkurds
so cynical of the electoral board to make preparations for snap polls on nov. 1 as pres. erdogan refuses to give gov-forming mandate to chp.
really not a good thing in the current regional context. erdogan's playing with fire
erdogan's gamble on bombing the kurds may backfire in coming election  #turkey
erdogan has drowned a country in blood for votes at the ballot box
@ohiomail @reuters i saw that the other day.maybe with more time on monday we can get more into it.. that damn erdogan! hope it blows up in
@rconflictnews very possibly he is right. erdogan in low hours crises may have used isis to win nationalists votes attacking kurdish
if, erdogan the terrorist, does not get removed and abdullah ocalan does not get released by august 30, turkey will be sliced in two
even the security forces do not want this war on kurds. erdogan is a brutal dictator in the making.
erdogan "knows that the dec. 17 and 25 corruption operations hang like a sword of damocles"
@mwforhr ..as the 1st november election nears erdogan may dither &amp; push us to do this difficult task &amp; take the blame
so tomorrow when i turn on the news, i want to hear good stuff, like how erdogan is hanging from his balls with his penis in his mouth.

erdogan wants to silence critical media ahead of the november elections. @nickkristof
@peterclifford1  i have not read the links yet, will do. agree erdogan is problem, turkish people not stupid.  may not last til election.
it is reality that isis are on the march in turkey and erdogan can't wait to receive them with open arms
@artisticforge @babydoll32407 @kurdistan_azad_ in the moment kurds do may be what erdogan wants, but akp is responsible f. killing civilians
@pkkurd @sarahleah1 pkk broke the truce july 15 by a declaration and then murdering policemen but erdogan is warmonger. yeah right
award winning @yavuzbaydar is accused of "insulting erdogan" he may face up to 5.5 years in prison. shame on #turkey
erdogan comments on recent escalation of violence: our public will (punish) some people for it on (elex day) nov. 1
erdogan is bringing the country to disaster. hope turkish voters will be able to disavow his crazy policies on 1 nov.
turkish nationalists warn erdogan with colored-revolution. "if erdogan continues with his plots &amp; traps,we may have to march to his palace."

@fleetwouldmac over critical of fleetwood mac, he may have been a little bias and edited some things out... just a theory :d

game of thrones season 5 for free may seem too good to be true, but that's only cause it is. my day went back to being terrible.
i'm so frustrated with game of thrones and i'm only on the 10th episode
desperately trying to stick with game of thrones but 4 episodes into the 1st series and i'm losing interest rapid.
one of my favorite characters on game of thrones just died i can't go to school tomorrow i'm grieving
everytime i reread/re watch game of thrones, ned starks death at the end of the 1st book/season is the most depressing. #got
before george r. r. martin finishes the next book, some of the game of thrones actors may die of natural causes. take your time george.
i've sat through five seasons of game of thrones and i still couldn't tell you a single characters name.
watching the 1st series of game of thrones is bringing back painful memories

@hughrundle @parody_bit @edrabinski hadn't read the full thread on 1st reply. i forgot people might not know google isn't live results.
i think google may be worried that if they allow people just to add sites on google now, then people will use it like google reader.

after a disappointing end to the 3rd season of oitnb, now to see what hannibal is all about.
@watiseyebrow noooo not yet. we had a birthday date night last night. plus i watch it on hulu, which means no hannibal until sunday :/
according to my dvr, the penultimate episode of hannibal is just the 4th quarter of a nfl preseason game. i could eat a face.
i thought i had enough strength for the hannibal finale. tomorrow is lost.
@eattherudecast i think it's hannibal and clarice on the run together, which i loathed, but bryan's talk of an "inversion" may make it work
hannibal's 3rd season feels like it became more and more a parody of itself.
bit concerned my brother hasn't read the facebook message i sent him asking him to bring me the last 2 episodes of hannibal tomorrow.
sorry, harper, but for once just take the blame. nats' blew the game.
@lawson890 @adamrubinespn @msimonespn @ynscspds goldschimdt? for leading a last place team? harper? may not even make the playoffs lol
what a tool @joelsherman1 is once again - fans leaving in the 7th inning in washington today is brutal.period. no reason to go after harper.
but hey, if you're mad at harper, go to the game tomorrow and tell him how you feel for all 9 innings
isis took last oilfield syria. harper's 3 bombing runs  may kill civilians not the problem or cause.  #cdnpoli #elxn42
if harper doesn't want fans to leave in the 7th perhaps he and his teammates should stop under performing and losing big ball games? #nats
choosing to read the transcript of the interview mansbridge did with harper due to the extreme 2nd hand embarrassment i'm bound to endure
@bruceanderson i feel it is 2nd rate. mansbridge doesn't point out when harper's not answering the question. debaters would do that.
@newbsradio let's go easy on the pigs. i just can't stand the sight of harper. it's the 21st century...can't we teach robots to love?

@cbcnews trudeau may do better if he attacked the ndp, no need to waste time on harper the media is 24/7 with the anti harper narrative
new election laws crreated by cpc makes it difficult to vote against harper even w/ 70% of voters against harper, he may still win #fixed

@shauncore he could, but harper has been a freak all year, and votto's 1st half wasn't amazing.
@mikewaiken at any rate harper is sinking fast he is talking resignation after 19 oct.
@zuckermancsn i hope someone asks harper why the team bailed in the 7th inning
shame all the fans that stuck around to see a six run lead blown and harper make an out for the 8th time in two games. #nationals
harper may never get a hit against the mets the rest of his career #lgm
@tedstarkey even a successful bunt puts us right they are now 1st and 2nd 1 out after the ibb to harper. so dumb.

i'm sat watching the worst harry potter film ugh
you'd think i'd be prepared for all the anguish when reading the harry potter books all over again for the 10th time. right? like fuck.
the pacing for the 4th harry potter movie was so ridiculously off and it ruined the entire movie.
"hey, can you set up apple tv so i can watch harry potter while i get fucked up?" --ladies and gentlemen, may i introduce you to my roomies!
@itzyourboy_ if you think harry potter is better ur not gunna survive as an adult lol honestly though when i went to logan 3rd was the best
everytime i watch the 4th harry potter, a part of me still thinks that maybe cedric will return to the port-key... but he never does *cries*
we're sat by the thames and orally retelling harry potter and the philosophers stone. i am the worst at this game.
non stop harry potter in our house since friday! make it stop!!!

@realdonaldtrump may not be my first choice for president, but i'm voting for him if he's nominated. at least he's better than hillary
hillary whacker @michaelsschmidt rehashes the same article he wrote 6 weeks ago. not one new fact in sept 7 piece.
#obama and #hillary may have used benghazi lie to win his last election but the #benghazi #truth will lose hillary's
this will be the 3rd "revamp" of hillary's campaign. her numbers tank each time. she just sucks at campaigning in the new media world.
@realdunaldtrump wait till hillary throws you under the bus like the rest. pleading the 5th?
@rufuskings1776 this must be the 20th time this old advice to hillary has been recycled as "news."  she is who she is. that's her problem.

@slone people are no longer in the dark, sm has changed the political landscape forever! hillary can't hide anymore
hillary's campaign now reset for the 4th time. adding humor and heart to a person that has #neither #sadtrombone

bernie sanders is about to torpedo any chance hillary might have of winning the white house going 3rd party. lmao

@abcpolitics @abc @davidmuir omgosh! hillary still using her deceased mom as a prop to save herself from her own lies. ~may she rip.
hillary apologizes the way kardashians wed--several times in quick succession &amp; never sincerely.
to look less guilty hillary requests staffers to not plead the 5th,but use 2nd &amp; 3rd together. by: @weknowwhatsbest
hillary looks as comfortable dancing with a child as she is coming out of the closet.
hillary: so all i have to do is have an unsecured server with national secrets on it, and i'll win? cooooool!!!
hillary will not make history as 1st female pres. she'll make history by being 1st pres candidate to be indicted on criminal charges.
@davidrook or hillary or sanders.  we may have to rethink this whole democracy thing if someone does not step up after the pre-season. :d
you may not have seen, but the left loves their liars, cheats &amp; traitors. hillary is their perfect candidate!
hillary just may be that stupid, look at some of her track record screw ups. history tells it all.
@kevininabq also, hillary may begin to give the perception that perhaps she may tend to allow herself to be portrayed as less than accurate.
@foxandfriends  hillary is sorry now that she may be facing criminal charges for what they found in her email
remember hillary denied a server existed  ever day ! a liar for president  like obama this country will not survive
@realjameswoods i hear that hillary's authenticity czar is going on the sunday shows.
wait. people claim hillary is showing her humanity because she chokes up talking about her dead mother? that may be the lowest bar ever.
did anyone see hillary's server boy actually plead the 5th or did his lawyers only do this in the media? @tgowdysc @greta @zerohedge
hillary can take her phony apology and shove it where the sun doesn't shine. she is only sorry she was caught it's all about power.
@outnumberedfnc @ainsleyearhardt hillary's 1st tele news explan "the server i used was set up by the secret service 4 the pres" y 4gotten???
secret service was at my house for hillary's visit tomorrow. quote of the day from one: "if you see the agents start to run - you run too".
omg people, we may not like hillary, but wtf, leave the kid out of it

this is starting to feel like less like a petting zoo &amp; more like jurassic park.  ~me at the strip club for lunch on a wednesday
one of the summer's biggest questions: when did we start acting like jurassic park was an all time classic and not 2nd tier spielberg?
so i've found at least 3 different typos in jurassic park since i started reading it. c'mon how long has this book been out?
im so bored i dont want to watch jurassic park for the hundredth time, i just want it to fucking be sunday already..
sitting here watching jurassic park: the lost world and remembering why the 1st one is my favorite. #ishouldjustwatchthat
i'm all for exploring but this look like the island from jurassic park lll i may have to skip
fuck a saturday class i just wanna go home and play with our squirrel and watch jurassic park
fuck me i took so long to watch jurassic park and kept pausing it and then i sat on the remote and it changed channels and now its live tv
stayed up late to watch jurassic world and i just remembered i have a football match tomorrow morning :/
i have the worst urge to watch jurassic world for the 4th time in theaters someone make it stop
we tried to watch jurassic world and watched like an 8th and the internet died on us :(
sat through jurassic world w/ a screaming baby in my ear + a 6 year old climbing up the back of my chair. ruined my experience @amctheatres
@greggibson86 @landoncreynolds tru....i may still need to glance it...because jurassic world straight sucked
@ameliamangan plus i may have hurt the feelings of jurassic world's director!
@der_lemke yeah i loved the 1st film and book. was disappointed with jurassic world (but i seem to be in a minority)
justin has been my bitch since the 6th grade
i hope justin's concert thursday gets cancelled bc of the thunder storm thats supposed to happen
@_datttass justin's girl, lost the baby!she was due the 20th... and then placenta had burst inside of her, and the baby wasn't receiving air
i don't see why justin thinks it's okay to work tuesday's.. it's fall were supposed to get $1 burgers at bar louie and blackout
@sassygaycallie i'll share 1st. i don't care for c-lud because of her weird crush on justin and how sorority girl she comes across. ur turn!
@justinlarson34 justin, i think you got that backwards. see my sep 3 post on obamanomics outpacing daugaardonomics:
justin is lost in the 1st minute. no experience #elxn42
i'm going to fight justin tomorrow during lunch idc idc dc
when the *nsync account tweets "tomorrow night they're together again," i want the "they're" to be *nsync.  not justin and jimmy.
probably going to complain another 20 times today about how justin performs on the today show tomorrow when i start school
i need to see justin tomorrow at the today show but i can't skip class :(
it's justin's funeral tomorrow, it was a pleasure to have known and worked with such a great racer. rip badass
i really wish i didn't have work or school tomorrow bc i'd so be in the city to see justin right now fuck my life
lucian favre having 2nd thoughts about gladbach qualifying for the champions league - juventus, man city and sevilla. group of death.
87 years of italian serie a history produced a first for juventus on sunday: they lost at home on the opening day of the season
@mast84 how much more? (to be clear i hate juventus) but this move doesn't make sense. they may offer 40 million to reach a deal so quickly
consult a dr. if you will watch the 2nd half of swansea vs manutd over roma vs juventus match @ 7:00
only going by the latest game stats but think i may have made a mistake backing juventus
as things stand, the bottom 3 in serie a are bologna (18th), empoli (19th); and juventus (20th).
this is very bad for juventus. lose in the 1st &amp; 2nd gionarta? something wrong with formation i think.. miss pirlo, tevez &amp; vidal already :(
juventus hopeless without their 3 key players and a poor transfer window. hope the cunts end up 5th in the league.
juventus had two men sent off as their dismal start to defending their serie a title continued with defeat at roma on sunday.
de rossi believes juventus may struggle to cope this season as he does not think they have adequately replaced tevez, pirlo or vidal
if draxler news is true, juventus has been humiliated this transfer window. may be leaving without the trequartista they need and 0-2.
@morningmika what was the reason u did  not ask questions in the kerry interview  sat in silence when u speak it is only to mock the right
@stephengutowski iran may regret it. but only if it happens under a gop president after obama and kerry are gone.
obama's agenda was 2 destroy american exceptionalism &amp; kerry is just dumb. what language does iran speak? we may need 2 learn it #tcot #ccot
@gulfwarvet123 @oceanbcake never have, never will; scumbag mbh lowlife pos maybe, but never pres. i hope the 1st iran nuke hits him &amp; kerry.
@webs1934 yes they do &amp; its sad that kerry being the 1st aa woman in 40 yrs to b lead on a show was reduced to a guest star on her on show
no, sam. the "we" in kerry's statement is unhcr, not the us government. important distinction.
never been a kerry fan but may they hammer 7 shites into dublin and wipe the smile off their smug little faces!

turns out watching the kurt cobain doco when feeling edgy on an oppressively rainy sunday wasn't a great choice. someone bring kittens.

had a dream that i saw nirvana live and kurt cobain sat and split his cigarette with me afterward and told me about life. woke up sad.
i think on some day's may the spirt of kurt cobain be with me so i dont  bitch slap everyone
courtney love doesn't want photos that could prove kurt cobain was murdered to be released. i wonder why?
..more tired than kurt cobain on his 3rd shot of heroin after doing sets every night this week but if i can find a spot tonight i'll go up..
smells like teen spirit playing between the top and bottom of the 10th. probably not what kurt cobain had in mind.
hey all the kurt cobain accounts that just followed me, he died in 1994 not 1993. april 5th to be exact.
nirvana was scheduled to headline lollapalooza in 1994 but dropped out on april 7th. kurt cobain's dead body was found the next day.
according to rolling stone, kurt cobain is the 12th greatest guitarist of all time... somebody actually thinks this and it hurts me.
don't trust the "new kurt cobain album": on november 6, brett morgen, director of the recent kurt cobain docum...
kurt cobain solo is not nirvana! nirvana is a four-piece! how dare you!? ;)
i think, sadly, that kurt cobain and philip seymour hoffman may have, despite their grim deaths, glamorized the drug
i'd say i want to be like kurt cobain but i can't bear the thought of living till i'm 27. blow my head off with a shotgun tomorrow.

"@xoticcherry 1st gucci is wack and his last good song was ""my kitchen"" 2nd future is trash af and don't nobody know what he be saying lmao"
trying to keep up with scott walker's position on the issue of the 14th amendment is about as easy as herding cats.
the sun is so stupid they know how much the boys mean to everyone and they knew how hard it was for us when zayn left this is so disgusting
well with zayn joining isis it is hard to maintain their family friendly image.
wait but when zayn left we got a facebook statement now the whole band is separating and we don't get anything just an article from the sun
why would the sun publish such a big announcement of 1d splitting up and not like what they did with zayn on fb?
1d stans gonna blame zayn for this .. just wait #wemissyourvoicezayn
the sun is bullshit 99% of the time but they're the ones who said louis is gonna be a dad and zayn left and look what happened
if i wake up tomorrow and seth rollins is still the champ i will be so pissed off
"why does big brother still exist? well, it's on channel 5, which some may consider a fate worse than cancellation."
"and even rolling stone is reporting on this crisis: ""america's vanishing bees may be the ""canary in the coal... "
changed my field hockey number from 5 to 4 bc zayn left but if the unthinkable happens this march i guess i'm gonna be number 0
if they really gonna disband it means that i was right when i thought simon is lying in those interviews after zayn left.  the sun
remember! original christians of usa choked the food &amp; water supplies of the pagans to make them toe the line
"school starts tomorrow and i'm still sad af about zayn, louis is a dad and now this tf #onedirection"
"@honestfandom the sun is shit in general! they made up bad thing about zayn, the baby news, harry and 'x' girl every day, homophobic liam"
this may sound sad but i've gotten so used to not having david wright play w/the #nymets that im ok if he doesn't return.
"i'm sorry, but randy orton is the most plain wrestler on the roster. he does nothing for me in the main event spot. 2nd is sheamus."
"yeah, everything is zayn's fault.even if we get a hurricane tomorrow, it's gonna be zayn's fault.u guys r disgusting "
i thought it was saturday and i didn't know big brother was on tonight how awk
@frankoniaz actually now they're all denying they ever believed the sun when it came to zayn.....not even they can keep up with their bs
so we still just gonna ignore the fact that frank ocean hasn't dropped his album and it's august 23 lmao ?
"i'm going to be quietly singing ""john cena sucks! john cena sucks!"" to myself for most of tomorrow. well done, #summerslam crowd."
"since seth rollins has stolen finn balor's sling blade and his finisher, he may as well steal his entrance... #bgsummerslam"
@bills4th @slashingthunder one other thing is that im gonna hear john cena on monday complaining how he lost so... for me.. not really
i would like to become a celebrity so that i may hit john cena with a chair actually.
fucking jon stewart just made john cena lose the match for his 16th world title because he doesn't want cena to tie flair. wrestling's great
jon stewart cheating he helps seth rollins win that some cheap monday night raw comes on tomorrow and i'm not going to be happy
john cena got screwed! 1st the ref got knocked out then john stewart comes out with a chair. disgrace! #titlefortitle #cenation #summerslam
@wwenetwork after watching john cena's match m really disappointed with this 3rd class system of wwe in summer slam..just like bull shit
bitch idgaf if you don't want to go to school tomorrow john cena lost
why is rolling stone putting donald trump on the cover? i may have to cancel my subscription.
if steve or johnny mac get evicted i may be done with this season of big brother. i can't stand james or vanessa either. #bigbrother17
crazy how naruto is still getting new chapters except now he's the 7th hokage. makes me feel old as fuck.

"@senorlariato i guess the world will end tomorrow, one of the signs of the apocalypse is john cena losing...god he sucks so bad"
@wweuniverse john cena has seth rollins a** in his hands tomorrow and someone please kick jon stewart's a** all over the ring
"@lawradio @wwerollins no, because he'll lose the u.s. title to john cena tomorrow night.."

everybody better hide tomorrow. if brock lesnar is there he will fuck shit up again. no one is safe lol
don't want to hear seth rollins speech about how great he is tomorrow bruh.
"//screw this, if kane doesn't return tomorrow, he'll be back in the fall."
@jimmytehfreak @wwetimekeeper and i didn't like the way the john cena and seth march ended too that pissed me off so bad
does anybody in pittsburgh want a ticket to see the foo fighters on tuesday at 7? it pains me to miss the show but...
@lesnarsupport yes. brock lesnar will appear tomorrow then he will be gone till before royal rumble
after what jon stewart did to john cena he better show up to work on monday.
the graves are full with people who thought they would practise islam when older not even everyone is promised tomorrow #realtalk
i'm so mad seth rollins is going to talk so much tomorrow on raw kiwi fuck i'm so mad

scott walker has decided that maybe gutting the 14th amendment is a bad idea.   i'm already over this election cycle.
eamonn holmes has dropped the biggest hint yet that he's going into the celebrity big brother house on thursday....
@_mcdialogue_  misrepresentation. what was said was that a lot of christians may not have full understanding of the trinitarian confession.
the hateful westboro baptist church protested friday's foo fighters concert in kansas city . . . and the band...
i don't know about you but i'd fuck caitlyn jenner till sunday and back
we should start bulldozing all the mosques in the us and europe until islam changes it's behavior.
"then the ""dirty""  muslims educated them about water and people started bathing.  "
damn foo fighters and #rickroll still in my news feed. now the 2nd night in a row i go to bed with that song in my head. on loop for 7 hrs.

"@johncena @wwerollins it wasn't a fair fight, it just proves that seth rollins can't win a title w/o someone taking his opponent down 1st!"
@mets keep uribe in. wright cant throw from 1st to 3rd on the fly. david wright sucks the life out of this team. he's an average player.

"if a genie gave me 3  wishes, my 1st would be to send all the rabid jew-hating zionist conspiracy kooks to isis wearing ""islam sucks"" signs"
'last friday night' does not depict a healthy relationship with intoxicants. do not invite katy perry to your parties

saddest part is christians give me the hardest time about it. jews and muslims? they know the score. 2nd verse is the first. touch butts.

if you even remotely support anything kanye west says i will say a prayer on sunday for you and your ignorance

its not about the money and player. its about moral &amp; club. we fucked up real madrid &amp; that's enough. de gea can join tomorrow. don't care.

murray a set down and 3-0 down in the 2nd set and bookies are laying murray at evens? ridiculous
@skysportstennis murray's career is characterised by a pathetic 2nd serve and an unwillingness to be offensive unless he's playing djokovic

murray always struggles on louis armstrong. how pivotal was that person disrupting his serve causing him to  lose his mini break in the 1st?

alright if you hate briana ok but like just ignore her don't call her names just leave her be if we ignore this it may just leave
unless briana was as virgin- the only thing i can tell @louis_tomlinson is dna test! she wouldn't be the 1st trying 2 trap a celebrity...
just saying briana got pregnant when she had a bf in march/april and louis and eleanor had just broken up isn't that just fishy
ok but louis hasnt been seen with briana since like what march ???? he is never with her and he looks so uncomfortable when interviewers+
"paps: this one if for the sun!! briana: *stands behind louis and poses*  so not set up, nope nope nope, not one bit"
in the paparazzi video where they take cliche for the sun you can clearly see louis not realising that there's briana behind him
briana may be pregnant but louis isnt the dad or atleast he is not excited about it you can obviously see it when he's been asked about it
so briana is allowed to smoke but not allowed to take photos by fans because it may affect the baby okay then.

alright kendrick lamar really scared me with this black friday bitch @kendricklamar
president thabo mbeki urged tony blair not to invade iraq but the british prime minister went ahead anyway.
will the pm stand by and watch his colleagues crush the voice of our people?: rahul gandhi
rahul gandhi talking about politics and policies is like studying for cat from a 2nd grade teacher. @roflgandhi_  #fakeintolerance
which is the harder half of a song...the 1st half of kendrick lamar's m.a.a.d city or the 2nd half of meek mill's dreams and nightmares?
(taken from  where the pm is clearly trying to avoid a future parallel with tony blair in history's view of him)

funny corbyn worries innocent people may be killed in syrian war but doesn't care about the people the ira killed
@mepadraigreidy @elliecumbo part of me suspects corbyn may march on his own party hq with stw &amp; blame it on tony blair. you never know.
@gerrymac6511 yo dicko!! it was pure sectarian bigotry from the ira councillor which started this in the 1st place !!
@ed_bradshaw @gamesnclass no the ira grew out of oppression &amp; internment &amp; bloody sunday &amp; ballymurphy &amp; kids killed by rubber bullets &amp;
if tony blair pipes up tomorrow someone shoot him. actually maybe he should and that will turn the vote!
@dpjhodges but the point is that corbyn's sympathy for ira is not relevant in deciding whether to vote same way as him tomorrow
the ira terrorist may be suspected of killing 4 british soldiers but he probably killed a lot more. the ira...
@edmendsfahey1 curtis good isn't good enough for the scottish 2nd division mate - another terrible buy to go with all of the rest.
@markberry i have a dislike of several labour mp's over their attitude to the ira &amp; so it may be the reason it first came to me.

"tony blair: sympathies for isis ""stretch deep into parts of muslim societies"". blair just went full trump. "
bloody sunday was the ira's biggest recruitment driver during the troubles. bombing syria is bound to have the same effect i'd have thought
tony blair saying the application of military force in #syria will ameliorate the support for #daesh at home. nope~&gt;
if you need convincing that bombing syria wrong/flawed/unethical then tony blair's support for bombing might assist

i think a big part of rick perry's fall is simply that he is not a sitting governor this time around. may be jeb's downfall too.
rick perry may have to drop out of the race, before one vote is cast, because he has run out of money. i have mixed feelings about that.

when sarah palin and donald trump speak for america, i think it may be time for a new revolution.
sarah palin's brain aged like a tub of sour cream left in the sun.

when sarah palin met donald trump via @guardian  'if this was journalism, it was not as we know it.'  #whitehouse2016

tina fey may look like sarah palin but she sure as hell has a lot more going on in the brain region #bossypants

my gods, sarah palin is genuinely crazy, isn't she...
@cnn - when you waste sunday pretending sarah palin or her opinions are relevant you just admit that you've given up on being a news source.
i think sarah palin may be one of the dumbest (former) political figures i have heard in my life. "speak american?" just shut up and go away
i think sarah palin may have a health issue . i had a hyper - active thyroid and i still can't remember all of the odd things i said &amp; did.
watching sarah palin telling people to speak "american" was the highlight of my sunday. that was some classic self destruction.
why does the media keep giving this brain dead moron air time?  former alaska gov. sarah palin said sunday she...
someone may want to let sarah palin know that american is a nationality, while english is a language.
it's possible sarah palin may be more of a moron than trump.. they said it was impossible
how is sarah palin still in politics. she was and still is the embarrassment of the gop, but she may be out done by some douche &amp; his toupee
i miss when sarah palin was a bigger deal, she was so easy to make fun of. saturday night live got so fucking lucky with her.
shouldn't sarah palin be putting her  little mind onto maters such as 'who is the baby daddy for my 4th grandbaby??
some low hanging monday fruit:  "sarah palin says immigrants to the us should 'speak american'"
sarah palin says us immigrants should speak "american", does she mean navajo or sioux?
sarah palin got french &amp; spanish "all mixed up" in high school. she would, wouldn't she.
sarah palin says us immigrants should 'speak american'  &lt; errrr she means english right?
@guardian "speak american" that may just sum up how stupid sarah palin is. i thought they spoke english in the us or a bastersised version.
fantastic! sarah palin demands that migrants to usa 'speak american'. can't make this stuff up.
hahaha - sarah palin wants immigrants to speak 'american'. they don't make 'em much dumber than her -
sarah palin says immigrants to the us should 'speak american'. just think: she could have been the vice president
today, republicans will talk about how much they appreciate workers. tomorrow they'll work to crush worker rights. #laborday sarah palin

saturday night live is going to have to find a new actress to play sarah palin, she's aged too much for tina fey to play her now.
@amandapalmer methinks one of the things that god dumped may have hit sarah palin on her noggin
sarah palin came out of a hole to let you know she's still shockingly ignorant
in boxing a 1-2 punch means a potential knock out if george w bush was the 1st punch in america's face, we were lucky to escape sarah palin
how does sarah palin stay so tan when she lives in a state that does not see sun 50% of the year?
the amount of people on facebook sharing the daily currant article about sarah palin is hilarious. (guys, it's satire. c'mon people.)
@mjosephsheppard never said that the dems weren't mistake-prone. sarah palin is just patient zero for the stupid. in her defense gbw was 1st
sarah palin may have some kind of organic brain damage.  she's incoherent and inappropriate most of the time.
donald trump, sarah palin, and ted cruz are going to be speaking at the capitol tomorrow and i'll be in class. damn.
@daxgyetmhanaak people wholeheartedly believing satire about sarah palin is what got her the reputation she has in the 1st place.
maybe this judge is on to something..unintended consequences to make scotus listen
@petapup1 @s3nt13ntb31ng @saculsacul won't  be the 1st time scotus violated the constitution &amp; won't be the last.
@simonbalac @yordydonald @abc bad example she worked th since january(&amp;her mom worked there4 35 yrs) before scotus gave homos special rights
@politicallaughs @kesgardner besides i don't believe that scotus has the power to overturn state marriage laws per the 10th amendment
@yowan @eyeamsmf  however, i don't think today's scotus and fed govt would interpret the 9th that way.  9th &amp;10th have seemingly disappeared
the 1st amendment is being ignored while the new federal right to marriage equality made up by scotus (marriage...
and @whytology article 3 gives scotus no legislative powers and the 10th amendment is clear. the 14th sec 5 requires an act of congress.
@jspoupart @joec1776 no. congress makes laws and the scotus settles disputes. in this case, the 1st amendment lost.
thanks for hating america, scotus. i hope you all get cancer. ok, good talk. cc: @potus
@realdonaldtrump  disappointed on your comment on scotus using the 14th amend to void millions of legal votes by state citizens. sad usa
suggestion - get familiar with 1st amendment.  it pretty much strikes down all scotus rulings regarding gay marriage, holiday celebrations
6th circuit &amp; scotus denied #kimdavis appeals &amp; upheld bunnings order, what the heck makes her crappy lawyer think they'll do something now?
it absolutely bothers the liberals that scotus ruled the 1st amendment applies to campaign cash as founder's intended! @cspanwj #pjnet #p2
@politibunny @brakinggnus @dangoddu @jbryant710 scotus violated the 10th amendment to the u.s. constitution not allowing #kimdavis #1a right
@israel4911 @letha_hughes it was the 14th that scotus ruled was being violated in blocking marriage equality. news not your strong subject.
the scotus claimed under the 14th amendment they could make the same sex marriage ruling. no matter how far you stretch it isn't there.
@sniffjenkum scotus has no authority to make law. only congress may legislate. #separationofpowers #abuseofpower
@cspanwj in their recent pro gay marriage decision, scotus has directly violated 9th and 10th amendments of the united states constitution.
clerk #kimdavis is jailed because scotus can see gay marriage in the 14th amend. but fed.dist.judge can't see religious freedom in the 1st.
1a: congress can't make law preventing religious freedom, so scotus interpretation unlawful const trumps case law
the kim davis case is just a sample of what's coming  to gun owners when scotus decides it wants to redefine the 2nd amend
@lrihendry @christiec733 what's scary is that it was only 5-4. like our scotus, irving may flip on one vote.
billy the kid - billy get your guns  via @youtube better get it before scotus redefines the 2nd amend
@tedcruz our 14th amendment is also under attack, which one do we chose? oh yeah it's up to scotus and they ruled!
@rushedlimbo you're literally incapable of intimidating me. anyways scotus interprets the constitution. mar equality is the law of the land
@close_michael @danagould disastrous? gore was asking a state court to violate the 12th amendment, the scotus stopped them. you disapprove?
@stonecoldchik the panthers are advocating the killing of police, scotus says that "true threats are outside the 1st amendment so why aren't
@alphakruse @suz123nj @papalputz @otterdose @matstaver scotus vitiated ky marriage law immediately b/c it violated 14th amendment
@thoughtsoftony @toddstarnes @shaephoenix hi tony. as usual u pick up the story at a convenient place in time. scotus imposed this on us 1st
#kimdavis appealed bunnings original order and both the 6th circuit and scotus denied the appeals  why does she think it'll change now?
@cybrpete so speaks the "soulless zombie" who fails to grasp the scotus decision was based on the 14th amendment #tcot  #constitution
@larryoconnor @gretchencarlson u sound like the hated "smartset" now? is #kimdavis the 1st to ignore unlawful ruling from scotus in history?
huckabee claims scotus made new law on ssm. no. the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment is more than a century old.
scotus cannot make law only rule on it. get real america.  unless it's healthcare.then they feel they can.
scotus apparently is saying that gays have an equal right to marriage under the 14th amendment.
ohio has defined marriage as one man and one woman, if scotus now writes law, guess ohio has no law and you may marry who/what you wish.
all you gun owner better get ready b/c the next thing scotus will be redefining is the 2nd amend
@fixthecourt  judge rules that he can not issue a divorce for same sex couple because of scotus decision.
skimmed it  may not like the scotus decision but it's the law. no offense, but your pope? climate change? seriously?
what's with this twitter account? it's like the seinfeld episode where they talk about themselves in the 3rd person.
i told someone about how i once sat on the floor of my hotel room and watched seinfeld for hours and they threatened to punch me.
@bgtennisnation serena can't fool me that 2nd set was a gift to venus. she didn't want to beat her in 2 easy sets.
@hbryant42 venus missed so many neutral shots in 3rd set that she never let serena feel the pressure; she let her off the hook, in a way.
@davidjonesrc serena&gt;venus yes.  if asante samuel doesn't drop an easy int eli may not even be with giants anymore.  you are eli #overrated

tgif....oh wait, i have to babysit for 7 hours all day tomorrow....
everyone's like tgif!  and i'm over here like i work tonight. and a double tomorrow. and sunday. and monday.  #grindin #needmoney
...and tgif!!! what a week... i really dislike the 1st and the 3rd.
tgif but even tho it's friday i'm not happy
yesterday was lastweek,and tgif was two days ago,which was also last week, so how the hell is tomorrow monday?
this bitch said "tgif" and it's monday...
tgif is totally meaningless when you have to work on saturday..just sayin;)#psybringiton
@thorharris666 or "happy monday" or "tgif" or... how about we all just shut the fuck up for a bit? the animals will appreciate it.
i prefer tgis than tgif now. cause friday is always a stressful day
tiger woods won't win and thankfully this will be the last time we see him til october
wow tiger woods is shanking his way through the 4th round!  can't handle the pressure.
@gctigertracker - once again tiger woods shits the damn bed on a  saturday, sunday or both (which both is what it is most of the time)
i was 2 optimistic yesterday when tiger woods was in 1st place..predicting he'd finish out of top 10. should've been 20 #wyndhamchampionship
tiger woods is the biggest tease of the entire weekend. in contention and blows it on sunday. next step play 72 holes instead of 54.
i'm here watching golf hoping tiger woods can do well and this ass hole triple bogey the 11th hole!!!
video: tiger woods carded a 7 on the par 4 11th, here's the 5 shot carnage around the green
tiger woods just ruined sunday for america.
@dylanbuckingham @colbyjpowell @toddonfranchise tiger woods did not play well on sunday, wait make that all year #tigersucks
sunday was a rough day in sports... tiger woods botched comeback, yankees dropped out first place, and djokovic got rocked at the atpfinals!
tiger woods' season came to an abrupt end on sunday: read the story: &gt;&gt;&gt;
former world no 1 tiger woods blamed his putting after struggling to an opening round score of 75 in the us pga championship on thursday
@buccigross and it just makes tiger woods look even worse than he may be.
@gordonkeith did you see the pic of the fake tiger woods sign at espn college gameday in fort worth on saturday?
serena has been twice as dominant as tiger woods ever was in his prime and she gets 1/10th of the accolades and adulation
@777mediaprod why is it because the flies are tom cruise from edge of tomorrow. try to do something die, restart.
why does tom cruise take 10,000 times to figure things out in the movie edge of tomorrow, but gets it right 1st time in mission impossible?
i would have enjoyed edge of tomorrow more if tom cruise had to start each day by re-spawning in the bathroom of a bubba gump shrimp.
finally watching edge of tomorrow nd surprise surprise, tom cruise is annoying in it
@gregthepaladin @padgettish @bootaide i mean it's 5th in a series, i don't expect perfection from that or tom cruise just good action
@pecunium edge of tomorrow was yet another tom cruise movie, which is to say it was too long, blew up too much shit, &amp; needed a better end.
from the guardian: benjamin lee, 'paul haggis: "shame on" press for not asking tom cruise about scientology'
my mum's friend is here and they're legit talking about tom cruise and i'm just sat here like ........
well, at least killing the douchebag is as entertaining as wondering how many times tom cruise died in edge of tomorrow #bloodpunch
sci article tries to make prehistoric animal's size relatable by calling it "as big as tom cruise". that didn't help.
wine update: i may have busted my ass attempting the tom cruise socks slide across the kitchen. asshole gravity. #mistakesweremade
geez..the labour leader has to be electable because otherwise a tory  govt will continue to do it's very worst.
especially the one's who work for tory donors &amp; circumnavigate agency rules heaping misery on our unemployed.
i did need to check to make sure this wasn't a junior tory minister i'd never heard of.
more economic ignorance and tory lies from teresa may for "a softening up" for the immigration bill
do you really think he gives a shit about scottish opinion,he's  a bloody tory after all
@iankingsky never have i read such scaremongering bullshit in the tory led sun newspaper as the shit you wrote in all my life!
theresa may, in her desire to win over the dunderheads who vote in tory leadership elections, really does personify the stupid party.
truth to "the scum" as we call it in liverpool is an alien concept. it exists to peddle tory lies #dontbuythesun
@djlujoso they just shrug it all off and quote shit statistics to satisfy themselves. so angry right now..gonna get some tory shit tomorrow!
cripes! boris crashes from 1st to 5th in tory grassroots leader poll (in just four months)
@talesofanalfa he's a far left, do-gooder fool...may even be a tory plant, who knows.
from "the zen of blair" no 3: "only those who reject the labour party may lead it;only those who vote tory may vote labour. this is newness"
theresa may is the tory leader labour should fear
labour saying they still have 'issues' with govt proposals on eu referendum 'purdah' plans, and may vote with tory rebels
@tom_watson a rumor may be circulation that tory front bench will be wearing emotional body armor when you and jeremy are elected.
i'm glad the tories won the general election in may. they're showing just how insensitive they really are vote tory. they do not give a fuck
jesus, when a tory government is slightly to the right of the sun...
daphne_miles @laboureoin @juliehunt1953 yes - i am afraid you may - we are reminded- the tory government as heartless then as now!
so cameron has lost telegraph and the sun over #refugeecrisis. so who supports him? do tory right really want drowned children on beaches?
the grassroots response to the refugee crisis should shame the tory government.
my level of hatred towards the tory government has reached a new high
no point asking for humanity from a tory. pretty sure they are all replicants created by the nazis after wwii. especially theresa may.
.@edwardjdavey blasts the tory attack on the green agenda in guardian today:  #libdemfightback
people will realize the lies that come out of tory mouths their not green and not for "hard working families" .
if scotland woke up tomorrow and decided we were going to vote tory, tommy sheridan would rip his shirt off to reveal a thatcher tattoo.
..the ramifications may feasibly tear apart the tory party for years to come. that said, the putative no campaign...
@margiebri @portlyplod a bit iffy that mail and sun take this seriously but somehow suppress anything about tory paedophiles
@lalamandi2205  to get into your worlds &amp; see just what you do the tory's are afraid of things that are really true. may....be
@sunlorrie - maybe it's partly because tory doesn't know what comes after september 15th.
scots why they think the approach may work, but there are basic questions that can bluetooth/wifi/smoke-signal would be that tory donors nee
sadly inevitable given tory guns. profit-making broadcasters won't fill the gap. sky has already dropped sky arts 2.
just a reminder if you voted tory in may youre still a fucking selfish twat 4 months on
the sun and mail, hate britain , hate working classes, want your kids to he stupid and vote tory....
@katiekhaleesi the sun is nothing but a disgusting tory mouth piece rag. i wouldn't line my hamster cage with it.
2nd tory candidate leaves race in one day after embarassing incident
@mixxi_bug they never do. remember, there may not be a tory govt after the next ge. they can't bind the hands of their successor.
nope torontonians wont have a voice, except for the howls as tory wastes our money yet again #topoli
never underestimate the stupidity of tory backbenchers.  nor think that #corbyn4leader couldn't win in #ge2020
@tomhawthorn mais oui*!  *not to be confused with 'may wee,' the warning that comes with tory plumbers
same dickhead sun "readers" out there who think we shd bomb #syria to protect uk are the same dickheads who voted tory coz they're ....
@conhome @hch_hill it may turn out the tory plan for a small state disguised as the 'austerity' agenda turns out to be dangerous in ni
@neon_shadows i said nothing of the sort. i support the 2nd amendment. trump wants to ban assault weapons. i don't.
fwiw, my own parental household may make me batty if "hopeful" trump stays legitimate into the primaries ... i'll snap.
@dexterroy527 @orangeblood2012 @al_gorelioni if you read again what i posted 3 hours ago you could learn finally trump is not my 1st choice!
huckabee today. trump tomorrow. ted cruz about to be upstaged twice in one week.
@tvaztecamex just used trump's mexico bashing speech to promote the oct 10 gave between #mexvusa that is low, really low.
jeb is an odd choice for a debut show. trump would have been the only candidate to have on his 1st show. #colbertlateshow
somewhere, trump sits watching, for the 10th time, that clip of the hungarian camerawoman tripping/kicking fleeing refugee kids, &amp; swoons.
trump says iran deal forces u.s. to defend iran if it's attacked by israel  via @politifactva false
@time perhaps he can eradicate the trump virus that's plaguing the usa. made his 1st million using daddy's millions. #clown
tomorrow anti iran  show : beck the crazy messianic nut job, trump the fascist reality show fascist. panderer cruz and quitter palin. wow
trump's hair detaches, becomes a tumble-weave. yeah it must be wednesday at ass-oclock.
trump, cruz to rally against iran deal: on wednesday afternoon, the circus is coming to the capitol.donald tru...
unfortunately it looks like trump may not be the answer. his answer regarding allowing syrian refugees here was not good.
if you treated #hillary2016 like you did christie or trump rather than as a human punching bag she may talk to you. #morningjoe
i wonder does trump know, make america great again was the klan's 1st slogan?
@modeledbehavior i think you should get down w/ "use trump style wall threat" to force mx into 1st world property law." i mean c'mon!
oh he using the racist dog whistle trump spews. #notgood
@chriscuomo your testing will come to an abrupt end thur 7am when you get schooled by trump on "the deal of the century".
i'd vote for trump as a joke (he's in the wwe hof ffs) but i'm too scared he'd actually win. at least he'd be the 1st pres to be stunner'd
do you know hotels are 17th biggest business in america? trump is 22nd largest hotel chain in america. in other words a pipsqueak.
"i would vote for trump tomorrow because that's funny" yeah you and a million other idiots @mrmikecalta funny doesn't fix shit.
but just so your warned if scouts ruled against 2nd amendment trump said we'd have to abide by that @ingodidotrust @slone
idk how i feel about going to darts every wednesday. like i'm pretty sure every person there for darts is voting for trump, but idk.
why many conservative pundits  r declaring war on trump. dec- laring war on the most candid &amp;  'for the people' candidate in  your lifetime!
i hope both the usmnt, and trump, for that matter, manage to take a huge shit on mexico.
then your boy trump must really piss you off, because he wants it too. but yeah, make america great. and stuff.
@realdonaldtrump @cnn match the contribution trump! that'll really show you care, this may come off as a point grab and turn negative.
@matt_mcnult my honest hope right now is that trump will not receive the gop nomination and run 3rd party, splitting the gop vote causing
republicans should check 1st before using songs for their rallies. eyeofthetiger+kim davis=absolutely not. same with trump. #kimdavis
@mickeyw1776 @americannaclub he won't he does not want to alienate trump conservative voters. may be looking vp if trump wins not sure why
that mexico vs usa commercial with trump gets your blood boiling. race war october 10th. imagine that parking lot. gaddamnnnnnn violence!!!
i may not like carson, but i'm going to feel genuinely bad about trump's mouth-breather following going after him
this guy says he brought rosie for trump, but he may be trolling the rally "just a little bit" #stopiranrally
racism towards latinos has risen since trump went public with his. white people feeling bolder
trump is really a presidential candidate....this is not the longest mtv awards skit, nor saturday night live or living color.  no, really.
this is so important. trump is playing on the racist fears of white americans and it's working.
the fact that they're cheering trump proves it.
trump is running for captain of the football team right?
it may be the end of the world as we know it, but trump's feeling fine.
@sherifffruitfly if trump gets elected, we'll probably see an ayatollah give a sitting president the middle finger for 1st time in history.
tsipras may be lamenting, but europe is much farther along the dialectic than the us. shit's gradual. don't be lulled by false necessity
what makes the 3rd bailout different is that, after tsipras, there will be no one left inside greece to credibly manage the memorandum
tsipras: (on referendum) i thought no was going to win, on thursday. on friday i was certain of it
after all these tsipras headlines, i wonder if they'll still let the athens stock exchange open tomorrow. will be a total bloodbath.
@normalcommunity @ypatia1 thanks. i reckon tsipras may be heading for the top three of the world's most disingenuous politicians.
do it like tsipras! ignoring problems won't make them go away; but still, you may go away with it. #renzi #rome
@steve_hanke tsipras is currently on holidays and on the 6th he is going to egypt. so i dont think he realizes the situation we are in
tsipras - "talks are in final stretch"  which is greek for "talks are about to break down and i may call a referendum any minute now"
after july 13th ,really don't give a damn anymore about greek politics.don't care if it is tsipras or samaras.greece is sold to the enemy.
@montse70v  on mar 23 i enthusiastically wrote the above about tsipras. now, unfortunately, i'm terribly disappointed about his leadership.
no big deal, tsipras reminds his admirers all over the world.  if possible, a 2nd emasculation won't be opposed by him.
@britainfirst it's like tsipras says, they're in the middle of a humanitarian crisis. bf should have their march cancelled, and the money
@hugodixon "more moderate" may be! but plenty of uneducated demagogs, who have not done a day's work....starting  with tsipras, himself!
it is not about tsipras, any more. it is about how the 3rd mou will be implemented. get over him ...
keep in mind tsipras' 1st state visit after elections was pope francis in the vatican. @ma000111 tsipras an atheist representing orthodoxy.
dont  underestimate the power of the pple, don't be sure tsipras will win, many who voted syriza the 1st won't now
@maxseddon @gorianov #pt may come in handy if medvedev has to have one of those talks with merkel that tsipras is so familiar with
elections seem the most probable scenario, as tsipras made a strategic mistake...  #greece
@yannikouts tsipras may just limp across the finish line in the general election because there's no real viable alternative pm...
it would be a strategic mistake of the 1st order 4 tsipras (let alone a genuine anti-austerity politician) to seek and maintain a leading ..
tsipras seemed like a teflon prime minister... but now it looks the mud is beginning to stick. by h.dixon
by capitulating to the troika, tsipras didn't just seal syriza's fate, he may have sealed podemos's too /
@chris58110 oh, it depends on how many people are pissing me off and the level of rage i reach! last time was friday night, about ukip...
@davidaslindsay @uklabour my area is so safely labour, you could pin a red rosette on a donkey&amp; it would still get voted in. now ukip is 2nd
far left have one thing in common with ukip mad conspiracy theory's about purges and they are the always victims
@fronteratech are you for real? ukip supported austerity in their manifesto! in a byelection in cornwall last night you went from 1st to 4th
bloody love europe, ukip can fuck right off! sipping a grimbergen ambre in the lyon sun whilst getting my beige on &gt; racist ignorant pricks.
i've a relative who is "traditional labour", moved to ukip in may  she's not impressed by corbyn. mythical that he can win these people back
if you did not vote ukip in may then you are a major part of the illegal immigrant problem and no part at all of the solution.....
@martyj21  idiots attracted to all parties. difference with ukip is media prepared to dig through years of profiles;
there's a simple solution, just deport all the far right wing tory &amp; ukip voting cocksuckers !
@lordashcroft went to ukip and ppl wont be fooled twice with weasel words i wont vt 4 them again it will b 1st time in 70yrs dc deceitful.
@independent backed by the sun &amp; closest to ukip - what does this say about the uk electorate! bigots united!
@davidjo52951945 no , ukip are just "nazi" , "fascist" , "racist" etc . heaven forbid they may have been right
@steven_winstone ukip is undoubtedly a threat to labour, not so tories but plaid may well hop into bed with labour to gain power.
ffs. enough. fuck the daily mail, the sun, ukip, front national and all other reactionary purveyors of hatred....
@meldrum @iainmartin1 65-70% of tory &amp; ukip voters still want to renationalise the railways, as do the 1st &amp; 2nd place cands for lab leader.
@eyeswatchin you may not like corbyn but to retweet ukip supporters is worse. more tory than the tories
may continues to disguise her "uk out of eu" view. she should do the honourable thing and resign and join ukip.
@sweeneyuk1 @roxley @douglascarswell @telegraph that's the problem with ukip, they want all other eu countries to put uk citizens above 1st.
theresa may calls for curbs to eu free movement and usurps many ukip ideas in the process:
so theresa may has today publicly said the same thing as what nigel farage and ukip get attacked for saying ??
@pperrin @nellesapelle very wise. hard to see ukip going any further tho. lab &amp; tory split may open up new space like you said.
so twitter, who do you think will be 1st labour mp to announce they are leaving for ukip on september 12th?? #jezwecan
my ma's so fucking ukip. she may as well be smoking bensons and sipping john smith's ale as she's giving off about the chinese
ukip may be out of the news but they are as poisonous as ever  one of their parliamentary candidates
ukip boy may have deleted his twitter profile, but those screenshots will be with him forever.
@rockerq they will not be safe. we will march on clapton with lead piping and beat ukip into the sea.
we've gone from a country that voted ukip into 3rd place for total votes, the party looking to seriously cut the amount of people coming in
@tweet4labour ukip polled 2nd in labour-held seats in the north, if we continue with tory-lite policies then ukip will crush us in the north
@gudbadanfozzy @davidsmith42000 @lbc you said he was the 2nd worst, he isn't &amp; ukip don't vote on non-uk issues
@paulwaugh to be fair paul, after snp, ukip, boundary changes &amp; 50 fewer mps, it may not be leader that's influencing the 80% who disagree
@barongraham i understand why people may support them, but i totally despise ukip. they're racist bigoted beasts, nothing average about that
@jamieross7 @mrjamesob i don't think she understood ukip  at all. suggest nuttily bennett may be more in step with her views
the same ppl who voted ukip in may are only defending migrants coming to the uk because it seems like the 'conscientious' or 'right' answer.
if there were an election tomorrow,ukip still wouldnt get a great number of mp's,i hate to say it but i think this country is about finished
deplorable and wrong-headed comments by bristol's only ukip councillor. i hope he loses his seat in may and ukip fold
@joerexrode sorry, joe, but the only way this team finishes 7th in the big ten would be major injuries to valentine, harris and tum...
@steve196508 evrn worse for people born around 14th november. just the result of a valentine's shag.
remember when i bought cute ass lingerie for valentine's day &amp; my boyfriend sat me down &amp; watched sin city instead of fucking my brains out?
valentine's day may be rather depressing for me but i barely get to see this...
it was february 14 on valentine's day, the roses came but they took you away, tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
i hope that guy goes all out for valentine's day. the fkn works. then a few days before feb 14 he checks her phone, and sees a few messages
valentine?!...it ain't even close to february yet...
one of the infinite reasons why valentine's day is the worst holiday in human existence
they think cause they said some vague shit on that friday in december that when valentine's day comes around and they're with another girl
this was the last sunday without #nfl #football until valentine's day.
i think i posted surprise incest in the golden sun fanfic category once on valentine's day. i was a terrible person.
@ruraljules if it makes you feeling any better....i got dumped by my 1st boyfriend, by note, right before valentine's day. :\
i get way too hype about october fuck february halloween is my valentine's day
dumbass christian thought valentine's day was on the 13th... bye
ruble sliding again today, with dollar cracking above 64 rubles, for first time since valentine's day in february.
but then i remembered she's the same hoe that never gave me a valentine's day card back in the 4th grade and stole my scented eraser.
"the world will end on february 14 in the year 2016." "valentine's day. bummer."
900 jews were burnt alive on 14 february 1349 in the "valentine's day" strasbourg massacre, where the plague had not yet affected the city
@jnmccrmck it may as well be halloween because people are just as fake on valentine's day. boom #goteem
see this is my struggle. don't  give me a valentine's day gift as a present, my birthday is the 16th not the 14th
why would you get married on sept 11th?! if you want a 'special date', pick valentine's day like everyone else, leave that day alone.
get me valentine's day hearts for feb. 14 and i'm taking it as a sign you're breaking up with me. love won't make you eat those things.
this is the last agonizing sunday of the year. no more of these until valentine's day.

i wonder if my 3rd attempt to upgrade to windows 10 will be the charm. i sure hope so it's taking several hours for each attempt.
so the windows 10 upgrade may mean that various assistive technology softwares financed by dsa don't work? awh what?
photos may not come tonight. updated to windows 10, reset computer and now it doesn't remember which photos it has and is currently 1/2
intended to finish my windows 10 slides for the aug @nelainfosec event.  couldn't connect sp3 to internet; gave up.  must complete tomorrow.
#money windows 10's real cost is to pirated software and games: microsoft may be about ...
clearly you haven't upgraded to windows 10 yet. good night &amp; good luck! #windows10fail
so apparently sony vaio laptops pre-installed with windows 7 probably won't receive windows 10 drivers until after november. #uninstallahoy
fuck it, i think it may be time to give windows 10 a try.  once i finish this download, it's time to nuke this shit from orbit.
beware - if you do not have to upgrade to windows 10 you may want to think twice before you do. we would warn you...
i'm in the process of updating to windows 10. close your home windows, wherever you are.....my screams may soon be deafening.
upgrading to windows 10 may be the worst computer-related decision i've made since deciding to play neopets instead of going to class.
windows 10 may be installed on 75 million pcs, but how many of those rolled back to their previous version, like me? suck it, microsoft.
1st blue screen of death in abt 7yrs and it happens aftr updating to windows 10.microsoft...*sigh* thought yall asses had it together by now
grandma's hiring some dude to work on her computer tomorrow.....  a bit worried.. he might try to get her to install windows 10.
serato dj isn't compatible with windows 10 yet :( ...got to spin on my old laptop saturday.
just spent 5 hours babysitting my 5th attempt to upgrade to windows 10 without success. not sure what's wrong, but it's getting ridiculous.
anyone having problems with windows 10? may be coincidental but since i downloaded, my wifi keeps dropping out. itunes had a malfunction
@allallen7 if the issue only occurs with windows 10 and not your other pc or device. it sounds like the issue may be with windows 10.
upgrading to windows 10. might not be recording tonight after all. may need to cancel tomorrow night's stream to record fable.
my ad/da interface drivers just went boom!  it seems microsoft is forcing me to upgrade to windows 10. i may gone some time...
@squeejay this is on windows 10, may have something to do with it; everything else is also slower than sh** through a funnel since 'upgrade'
microsoft needs to get their shit together. xbox live just went down for a 2nd day, what a fucking surprise @xboxsupport  #xboxlive
@xboxsupport abt time we got a reply from xbox 4 hours and counting, this is the 3rd time in a month what u doing to fix this issue xbox
so the xbox live servers are down. no more cod till friday :(
@thepieface i hate it more. my xbox controller is in london so i can't play until sunday
so, i have to wait until the 15th for the taken king on xbox? this some bullshit
@mrtlexify my xbox box live expired last friday the struggle are real
just sitting here staring at my xbox waiting for the #destiny update to finish downloading. 30 + minutes. i may die waiting...
what will the destiny 2.0 patch be at when i get home? 70% 48%? 95%? 2%? who knows. my xbox may just be on fire the way things were going.
@bungiehelp i've sat here since 7 its now 1am and it has moved 2% i'm off if it's not done when i wake i'll be ringing xbox for a refund.
no roommate, you may not get on xbox live at midnight and talk deadass loud with ur online buddies when i have an 8 o'clock in the morning..
@konamisupport yo wtf why can't you fix the severs on xbox one for fob it's september 9th and again can't get on
this may be our last chance to see zlatan in the world cup and fifa totally fucked it up. shocker.
friend with connections just offered to let me meet zlatan &amp; co. in nj tomorrow. alas, my body sucks and i cannot.
so, about zlatan... i don't want him. all reports are that he's not a good teammate. he'd be our 3rd dp fwd, how do you work the 3 together?
@occupybears he fancied rolling the ball to zlatan on the edge of the box early on and then he totally fucked up for psg's 1st goal...
fucking cunt. i hope he eats zlatan's shit in retirement league.
@minoraiola just because your hunger for more money zlatan will play in a team that finished at the 10th place and struggle for top 5,shame
watching a replay of the psg / lille match from friday. no zlatan makes psg unwatchable.
@acmilannorway anyway, telling zlatan he'll be the center of the team is like telling the sun it's the center of the solar system. no crap.
the top 4 strikers in the world are not for sale and our coach can't handle the 5th (zlatan)
today united should have done better, the referee didn't help at all!!!!  rooney to 10 pls! just sign zlatan tomorrow pleeeeeeze
if there is a silver lining this shows lvg if we dont buy anyone b4 tuesday we is fucked!! fuck it i would take zlatan!!

#timesofindia .neymarjr may make barca return against malaga: coach  via toisportsnews
yo! chelsea! remember when barca said fabregas was poo poo in the 2nd half of the season. no refunds
vermaelen starting for barca 2nd time in a row. didnt think he'd play that much for them.
@mediocentroen that he's a 4th choice cb at barca and has started two games?
@noelle_cruz think they put him number 3/4 these sky sports pundits are pro barca,  spent ages talking about messi's win on thurs.
we now just need less than 4.5 goals in the barca match and real match to land the 32/1 7-fold. i may cover our bet before the last match
i hope that barca does a lot more better in the 2nd half then in the 1st half.
i honestly think what we're seeing with fabregas is really him and why barca were quick to part ways. last august-november was a one-off
i can't believe the last time barca scored against malaga was in january 2014, that's odd. my money on malaga to win tonight #bbceurofooty
again, awful from barca. not the best result, they should get 3 goals or more. calderon on the 12th, serious.
pedro sat bench for barca &amp; kdb wins poty in germany but yet pedro is the "better" player.
barca on the other hand could have problems. must avoid injuries and stay in touch til jan and probably add 2 more on top of arda an vidal
at least we won't face de bruyne for wolfsburg in the champions league, or against city when they get barca in the 2nd round
@oldtraffordreds i look at his past record 2 n it's awful nearly got barca relegated nearly finished 5th wif bayern b4 he got sacked
@rafaelh117 @dianakristinne  do you guys think if barca reaches january as leaders they can win the league and whether team can achieve that
@ephowie did you not see my reply? barca's front 3 tomorrow. don't even @ me.
@lewis59453181 yer some argentinian kid from barca is flying in tomorrow, apparently traore has told him it's good at villa.
does barca's transfer ban expire after tonight or on the last day of december?
@_suprene @sintripas_ if he can play then i hope he plays against barca, on the 20th
so de gea will be just like the barca situation, can't play but is basically at the club because he should leave when january comes
if ddg is stuck here till jan, can we offer him to barca just to annoy madrid even more.
madrid and barca run the la liga, not a chance ddg won't be a madrid player by tomorrow.
of course it will be, when barca can sign a player inspite being banned from signing, why not real get 1 minute.
@halamufc @swagattt @joelsimondsouza personally i think utd should just tell madrid, the deal is gone and then in january sell ddg to barca
barca fans when they saw "uefa will study the case tomorrow. they will make a decision on the de gea case"
@tigeramer10 @sergemufc .. which they won't do as they are facing a transfer ban akin to barca. even de gea going january misses the cl.
barca won the treble and had a transfer ban yet they signed two players. arsenal came 3rd in the bpl and they didn't buy an outfield player
@the__fundraiser barca turned down the opportunity and experimented with suarez. bayern haven't opened a cheque yet[have 1st preference]
@rafaelh117 he's a fraud who will be gone by may. bet you weren't saying this when he was at barca
ben lederman may well end up being the first american to play for barca but, for the time being, it sounds like he's heading to florida.
@bluekippercom @edmunddafox he's off to barca in january
atletico madrid is going to be dangerous..pedro leaving is going to hurt barca in the long run..no bench to rest msn
.@ may make barca return against malaga: coach
yea, just play for u21 when the club asks, u may had won a lot wit barca but that is past, tis is unitedddd(spartaa)
can only mean one thing: he is joining barca - probably in january.
@fcbmjohnkj psg could be the 2nd best team in the world behind barcelona but they always get barca lol, so we would never know
@haidar_altaie @footyquestions1 exactly. only reason torres even came back into the lime-light were for 1st minute goals vs madrid &amp; barca
arda turan got cramp, i am not surprised! sign for barca but can't play til january, what do you expect lol
@andrewmperry the thing though is if pogba ever does leave juve it will be to barca, also my team isn't in 13th place right now.
we are not real barca or bayern that players would be ready to join the club as a 2nd/ 3rd choice. on what grounds would you bench coq/santi
neymar was always gonna be something special. i honestly hate his role at barca, he might be good, but he has to play 2nd fiddle to messi
barca want midfielder, forward in january
(a) "things" don't "bounce off" batman.  that's superman. batman dodges. (b) trump isn't a playboy, he's married.

@r_stewart03 last wednesday, when i saw you dressed as robin, all i can think about is "who's batman? where's the teen titans?"
@040hz i mean, batman was corny af until this trilogy, the 3rd one was so not batman.

@skysportsnewshq the news should be federer qualifies for 8th cincinnati final. not murray knocked out.
my preview of the western &amp; southern open final on sunday between djokovic and federer for @betfairexchange
iaaf world champs, super sunday bpl, la liga, federer vs djojk cincy final. best sporting day for ages.
so djokovic beats federer and murray stays at no 2. mon the djoker! #cincytennis
djokovic looks physically better than against goffin &amp; dolgopolov, he may beat federer today; probably he played only 70-80% in previous rds
federer will have to serve into the sun here.
djokovic up 6-5 in the 1st set.  federer leads djokovic in all-time tiebreaks, 11-10.  #tennis
federer will be 2nd seed at @usopen if he wins this. djokovic aiming to become 1st player to win all 9 masters 1000 tournaments #cincytennis
federer takes the opener 7-6(1) against djokovic. better player in the set &amp; winning plenty behind the 2nd serve.
has federer shocked murray and djokovic with his turbo-charged aggression? will they respond? new podcast tomorrow
you're going novak end of the year, and federer arrives
are they holding the davis cup semi at the us open?! @andy_murray v @nickkyrgios , 1st round. later: anderson, wawrinka, federer, djokovic?
most masters 1000 titles (27) 2nd most grand slam titles (24 tied with sampras after federer's 17)
just got to watch federer win 4 consecutive points to get the decisive break in the 3rd set before mom snatched the remote citing god!
5 time @usopen champion federer defeats 29th seed kohlschreiber and he's through to the last 16 to play 13th seed isner or vesely! #usopen
federer is through to his 15th straight 4th round at the us open. he's 8-4 with two other wins by walkover.
shriver to federer suggesting that he not use the sabr vs. isner "you want to have your 3rd set of twins i'm sure."  interview ended there.
federer is gonna be playing in the championship on the first sunday of the nfl season. tough decisions

federer's next match is going to be the 1st obstacle he faces on his way to the finals. his first serve needs to be on point against isner.
survey: federer has ostensibly the toughest 4th round match, but is there a tougher one? does isner win a set? does rba?
@john_mcenroe which men's match do you think they will play on the wednesday night slot?  federer, djokovic, or murray!?
'sneak attack by roger' (sabr) causing errors this game for federer. may be it's isner's height #usopen2015
in french open qf, federer didn't break serve -- 1st time in slam match in 13 years. tonight he breaks for 1st time in his last return game.

maybe now you guys understand why i changed my name from save hannibal sam to hannibal killed sam on thursday night #hannibalmicdrop
ugh also i forgot hannibal is ending...i never kept up with it but i still feel pretty sad it was a damn good show, 1st season
ugggggggh i want to watch hannibal finale but i am too tired. perhaps when i get up tomorrow i will
i'm just sat here crying over the last episode of hannibal #bye
i would've preferred that episode 4 of hannibal season 3 was the 2nd episode of it. would've been better to check on everyone earlier.
this has also been the 1st episode of hannibal that had no tension, action or killing at all. also, almost no (new) hannibal lecter scenes.
"hannibal" may have ended but you can still express your love for your "murder husband" and hannibal with this...
on saturday night, the season - possibly series - finale of hannibal aired on nbc. grantland's alex pappademas,...
i met em and blaine through hannibal. i may have my issues with the show but i'm modest enough to respect that.
@natalehb unfortunatly irl i don't know anyone who watches hannibal with me so i'm really looking forward to saturday :-)
@_grumpycoconut monster is an anime. hannibal is a live action nbc show. it just finished its 3rd season.
@phoenixempathy - he crosses his legs once he was sat. hannibal raises an eyebrow upon hearing the teasing tone of the other's voice, he -
what mads may want to everyone when he received the script full of hannibal's vocabulary or intellectual talk lmfao

@arthurrcustodio - ahhh don't talk about it!! i'll start tomorrow night at home or the day after. need to finish hannibal first
my mum just asked me what we're supposed to watch now on thursday nights since hannibal is over ;a;
help help it is thursday and my brain is saying hey remember back when an episode of hannibal would be airing in 2 hours in canada
@sharingtheguilt -may try and poison me? hmm?" hannibal stood straight, he said that in an almost sarcastic tone but this was still a cat -
@someotherworld @brasspetal @darklinggrotto we need to reach the speed of light, we may need hannibal's help
photo: that moment on saturday night when you realize that hannibal is over.
@brianperniceday @lecafedufacade so used to watching hannibal on saturday i am shocked i am going clubbing. #hannibal #fannibalsarentdone
@t4rd1s nah it was there for a few years. breaking bad, first couple of seasons of got, hannibal, mad men, 1st season of true detective, 1st
@frygtcanophilis hannibal was still in the room sat on the chair reading
okay i'm going to watch dexter and hannibal and get high and sleep because fuck monday.
let's be honest, hannibal may be many things but he's not a rapist which disgusts me more than killing, cannibalism &amp; everything else.
@sanecanophilis -- tomorrow." hannibal squeezed half the contents across his lover's burning cheeks.
@frygtcanophilis hannibal removes his hand from your forehead, will's temperature was back again. he sat down beside the younger man -
@theericgoldman seriously, when people lament they didn't take the 1st possible deal for hannibal, i tell them go watch lost in la mancha.
@frompillow but idk when i'm gonna get around to hannibal and i know wonderfalls is just a season, so i may just tide myself over with that
@skylivinghd i'm going to be lost without hannibal on a wednesday
several of hnb's staff will be serving at the early bird kiwanis pork dinner this friday the 11th, 11-6 pm at y's men pavilion in hannibal.
lots of crime action in hannibal the past two days... check it out in tomorrow's @hannibalcourier
jerry vance may no longer be a conservative candidate but maybe harper can name him to the senate. #elxn42
unpopular opinion:  harper is right to think nats fans ditching in the 7th inning was brutal.  no sure he was right to say it though.
gazette: "bloc is open to coalition with anyone except harper, duceppe says". of course, anyone may be only ndp. #polcan #elx42
harper's worst offense against refugees may be climate record as rising temperatures add to chaos in the middle east
@adamrubinespn harvey thanks you for this scene harper. takes the attention off him to pitch tomorrow lol.
i stand with harper on this. you shouldn't be leaving in the 7th on what essentially is a playoff game. it's not like the game went
there's only one minister in harper's pantheon, and he's 100% prime... (may contain antibiotics, hgh, gmo...)
@dcsportsbog harper will issue an apology through the team no later than tomorrow.
yeah, harper went 0-3 tonight. that doesn't mean he doesn't have every right to call out every single fake nats fan that left in the 7th
watch harper's toupee suddenly look alot cheaper oct 20 when our taxes are no longer paying for it. #elexn42
now that he's in 3rd place in polls, harper unveils inspiring new slogan: "i'm not perfect." circling the drain time. #elxn42 #cdnpoli
harper,s high standards for candidate selection, dauphin swan river mp running for the 3rd time un nominated, stamped by harper
but for the first time since the writ was dropped, i really have no idea whether harper will be pm after oct 19th, or who would replace him.
@gublernation "harper" looks tired. do you ever sleep? then again, i should be too. i have to get up early tomorrow.
@jenditchburn it's happened. harper may try again. what said last night won't matter, it's cling 2 power by whatever means or pogey. #elxn42
@jenditchburn harper's a 1 trick pony.  throwing $ from a helicopter doesn't make up for clear lack of cpc vision.  3rd place &amp; dropping.
new cpc ad: harper may not be perfect, respectful, reliable, accountable, truthful, but... wait where were we going with this?  #elxn42
harper will be history after oct 19. his calgary riding voters should keep it in mind. if he will not be around...
@wrighthfx @ndp_hq you may have principles but lack reality. liberal far out perform harper &amp; mulroney's record. too bad
@lynn_carleton the consortium too. i wanted harper's hand to be forced &amp; w/ 3rd in polls, he'd have no choice. mulcair let him off the hook.
"harper spoke tuesday on how the cons will balance their security concerns with more refugees into canada". instigating hate #cdnpoli
not sure when harper chat is scheduled to end (may have already), but he's taken 19 questions so far. #cdnpoli #elxn42
super girls:dillion harper gets kinky with april oneil in saphic massage   #bigtits
@adamrubinespn i'm happy to see the #nats sat zimmerman over harper...harvey owns harper #mets
mulcair, harper and trudeau still in close race after campaign's 1st phase. leaders considering time-sharing the country.
harper may be right, it's pretty empty in nationals park tonight. #nats  #mets
michael den tandt: harper says he is who he is, take him or leave him. that may not be enough -
due up for #nats in the bottom of the 5th:  werth (0-2, .225)  rendon (2-2, .268)  harper (0-2, .334)
@thomasmulcair thomas, you must use this against harper even if it did come from ignatieff.
@dcsportsbog harper misspoke yesterday. the brutality in the 7th was on the field. same as tonight. #nats
he's bunting!? that leaves 1st open to walk harper and set up the dp
harper walks. #nats now have two men on with one out. escobar will bat next. still 8-7 mets in the bottom of the 9th.
looks like harper left in the 7th two days ago.  #nats  #splatitude #firemattwilliams
harper upset with fans    when @bharper3407 runs out every routine grounder to 2nd then he can complain about the fans
"where's the sun mommy?" "it's asleep like you should be" "but harper's a moon mommy"  dammit kid.
do #mets walk harper if rendon gets bunt down?  is matt williams under the weather? pap in 8th facing bottom of order? left storen out 2 dry
harper doesn't want to see you leave unless you're stretchered off. #brutal
@sbnationmlb @sbnation the idea that the mets would have walked harper if it was 1st/2nd no outs in lunacy.
i wonder if this kind of heckling will happen tomorrow when harper holds events in #pei? what say you, islanders?
does anyone know where harper will be appearing tomorrow on #pei?  #charlottetown?  #summerside? the coward is keeping it secret again.
oct 19: election day; also harper's last day at work. #elxn42 #cdnpoli
i think the #ndp may have made an error being to focussed on harper and forgetting about trudeau who is now leading in the polls.

dustin johnson must have celebrated a bit too hard and too prematurely on sat night. he finishes at -4 dropping 6 shots in the final 2 days.
dustin johnson somehow just went from 1st to 50th in two rounds.

"and thank you for stopping by, dustin johnson. maybe he just doesn't like monday mornings."
@tyler_tremelle was angry at me after friday because dustin johnson was outperforming jordan spieth. he's now quite happy with me.
paul dunne has an even par front nine. he is -12 and three off the lead at the open. harrington has birdied the 11th

3rd day of eid is now going to end.... how was your eid friends ?? did you miss mubii...
paul dunne hasn't had the best of rounds. oosthuizen bogeys the 13th and now 2 off the lead. between 4 players realistically now.
paul dunne now tied for 19th through 13 holes. he is 4-over on the day and 8-under overall.

"lawyers argue that yakub filed mercy plea for the first time in his own name on wednesday. hence, he should get 14 days' @renu_18"

each of yakub's family member will file mercy petitions at the gap of 13 days each.
