Having not been home in the last 2 years may skew this reviewer a bit, but the food was tasty and spicy sans the oil that comes floating along at similar venues.
This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.
Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.
The staff offers impeccable service.
All the appetizers and salads were fabulous, the steak was mouth watering and the pasta was delicious!!!
The fish is fresh and each piece is sliced to perfection and seasoned by the sushi chef (usually with a little fresh wasabi and soy sauce but also sometimes with some sea salt).
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
The calamari comes with an incredible sauce, and the duck noodles are yummy as well.
I recommend the garlic shrimp, okra (bindi), and anything with lamb.
You don't go to Mizu for excellent service, you go for the large amounts of food, the amiable atmosphere, and the hole-in-the-wall feeling of the place.
These innovators of french indian fusion do a great job of making dishes as interesting as possible while still being accessible.
The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.
THE FOOD PORTIONS ARE REALLY LARGE.
Ambience is delightful, service impeccable.
we split a tasty vegetable samosa and the malai tikka wrap.
THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.
Excellent atmosphere, delicious dishes good and friendly service.
The service was attentive without being overbearing and each dish we tried was wonderful from the spring rolls to the cod with pineapple tempura.
Over price, and small portions .
All in all, this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city.
We were also seated promptly at the time of our reservation and the service was very quick and professional.
The place is a little tight and on a cold day, the seating by the entranceway can be pretty drafty.
They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.
Such nice people working here - but I have to review the food.
very good breads as well.
We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!
The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.
He not only makes his own homemade mozzarella, but every pie is ultra fresh.
This is the only Thai place I go too in NYC, it's wonderful, and live relaxed Jazz on certain nights.
Went on a double date with friend and his girlfriend for a few drinks and appetizers.
delicious bagels, especially when right out of the oven.
The staff is also attentive and friendly.
I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.
The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree.
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
The service is awful.
Orsay, is a very pleasnt throw back to traditional French food, and French service as well.
The lunch special is an asbolute steal.
Had 1 appetizer, 2 entrees and 2 cokes and the bill was ~$55.00, not including tip.
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.
We ran a little late for the reservation but it wasn't a problem to get our table immediately.
we did notice however, that some tables had what looked like pita instead of naan.
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.
The people with carts of food don't understand you because they don't speak English, their job is to give you the delicious food you point at.
The food is outstanding and the service is quick, friendly and very professional.
The plain slice is great and if you get toppings, the whole slice is topped with them, not sparsely sprinkled on like some places.
I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.
They have it all -- great price, food, and service.
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate.
The food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates.
Service is highly refined: our seating was delayed 35 minutes past our reservation and the maitre d' apologized and regularly kept us apprised of progress.
The jukebox plays everything from Italian Opera to The Strokes.
The service is good and the resturant is clean.
I have been there many times, and food is good and consistent.
As a long-time patron of Mamoun's, I always figured that I had found the best late night food spot in the city.
Solid wine list, knowledgeable staff, friendly owners and an adventurous, ever-changing menu keep us coming back.
otherwise, good stuff for late nite eats.
Spreads and toppings are great - though a bit pricey.
I LOVED THE SHOWS.
We started with lox and mussels (the best ive ever had, ever) and had the cod and trout for dinner.
But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.
You rarely have to wait for a seat and the currys (masaman, green, red) are full of flavor and come super spicy if you ask for it.
The food is okay and the prices here are mediocre.
Try the sea bass.
For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more.
Bottom line: B+ for the food, F for the service.
We would like to thank Marcelo and Grace for a wonderful dining experience!!!
Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.
The highlight of the night was the mayonaisse for my side of fries I received from one of the food runners, which is not good considering the bill was nearly $100.
This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.
We were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry.
Lunch came with pickels and slaw, no extra charge.
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.
This place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a  restaurant, the food.
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
Great bar, most gorgeous bartenders you've ever seen (specifically the blond lady).
The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).
Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps.
This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!
My boyfriend and I recently had an early dinner at Artisanal and was satisfied with our experience.
Love the Jazz bands on Fri and Sat.
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.
NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff.
Each table has a pot of boiling water sunken into its surface, and you get platters of thin sliced meats, various vegetables, and rice and glass noodles.
So much more than the usual bar food, go there to enjoy the menu while sampling one of their hand-crafted beers.
We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!
You order from a menu, so you leave feeling like you missed the full experience.
This place has realy fresh sushi and a nice large menu of Japanese classic cuisine.
In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.
The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.
My wife and I will usually only order one primi and one secondi and split them, as they tend to offer large portions.
It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap (undercooked) beef.
they did give a 15% discount at the end, wasn't enough, as they knew the service was horrible.
I've overheard comments from him to his employees that should not have been delivered in the dining area and I've been sitting there while he lectured another customer.
I like Mamoun's food as well, but side by side, Kati Rolls just produce tastier food hands down.
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.
Little Tonino's is just awesome, our favorite delivery place in Kennsington, honestly the best Gnochi I have ever had!
We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.
Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
The sicilian is my favorite it is moist not dry like most places but all their pizza is great!
Their exotic salad is basic ly a delcious little green salad with a peanut sauce that is perfect before their sweet basil fried tofu.
The service was excellent and the food was delicious.
I've been to this restaurant more than a dozen times and when I'm craving for Pho, Lemon grass chicken or Beef Cube on rice, this is the place to go.
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!
If you're looking for a great meal at a decent price, go to Del Frisco's!
While the prices are nothing special, the portions are huge.
Awsome Pizza especially the Margheritta slice.
I LOVE their spicy scallop roll, and my boyfriend consistently gets the sesame chicken.
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.
We were well attended to by the enthusiastic staff especially the manager Tony Gaskin who made excellent suggestions for our menu selections.
The waiter actually poured water on my hand and walked away.
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.
If you live in Upper Manhattan, Siam Square is THE place for Thia food.
Service and food is what any one would expect when spending that type of money.
First went here to enjoy their garden terrace.
Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks.
My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily.
We actually gave 10% tip (which we have never done despite mediocre food and service), because we felt totally ripped off.
Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.
The flavors are great, and the menu is extensive.
The place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening.
Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.
I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta, panini's.....
The menu has lots of options: I hope to go back to try those potato pancakes.
This isn't your corner Chinese food takeout.
The owner is very friendly and a great guy, go try his pizza, you'll like it!
The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.
Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.
We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.
I would not have been so disappointed with the portions if the qualities were good enough to make up for it, but they were not!
The sweet lassi was excellent as was the lamb chettinad and the garlic naan but the rasamalai was forgettable.
The food is great, service is ok.
Our friendly server made great food suggestions and also sent both the sommelier and the fromager to the table to help suggest different pairings for wine and cheese.
The photobook menu was a cute touch, certainly helped my group and I pick the fried chicken, pork chop, and noodle dishes that we all ordered.
But the staff was so horrible to us.
not only does make the best pizza in NY , maybe anywhere.
Great food, good size menu, great service and an unpretensious setting.
Quality ingredients preparation all around, and a very fair price for NYC.
The food was just OK, I would never go back.
Really tasty spring rolls and noodles for a good price though.
My goodness, everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing.
The food at this place is 'gourmet' Indian cuisine.
The menu prices are a bit expensive for what you get in quality and portion size.
$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.
The bill is approximately $25 for 2 at lunch without drinks.
The staff is accomodating, the ambiance is exciting and yet relaxed, and the food is out of this world!
Highly recommended is the Spicy Fried Clam Rolls and Spider Rolls.
The strong scents coming from the left and right of me negatively affected my taste buds.
While the new restaurant still features much of the same classical furniture that made Tiffin so attractive, the menu has been overhauled.
Very popular style Izakaya (Sake and small portion of sake-friendly dishes ).
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.
THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.
The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly.
He was terribly thirsty after the meal too.
The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.
The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.
So, for good food i'd recommend it, but not for a fun night out.
Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!
We visited Bread Bar during January restaurant week and were so pleased with the menu selections and service.
I care more about the food and ambience.
My GF and I still choose to eat there a lot because of diverse cocktails, the chill decor, and the decent sushi.
The place is larger than most and features adequate seating unlike most joints, and has a bar which deserves a mention.
The main downside to the place is the nazi-like guy running it who constantly complains about the noise level.
By far this is the only chinese desserts place I know in NY or anywhere close in the Northeastern America that serves desserts with frog jelly in a couple of varieties and pig feet ginger simmered in black vinegar.
The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.
The menu looked good, except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside.
This is a consistently great place to dine for lunch or dinner.
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.
The dim sum is delectable while the prices are quite easy on the wallet.
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.
It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.
Service is friendly, prices are good - delivery time was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, I'm willing to overlook it.
try the spicy shrimp appetizer (again, not the greatest value in the world but worth the price) and the lamb vindaloo is great.
While we enjoyed the food, we were highly disappointed by the poor service (waiter was not quite competent and SLOW service) and lack of remorse.
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.
The makhani was OK --the korma was bland.
No dress codes, no attitudes, plenty of comfort companionship, a great place to relax in an always busy Midtown.
The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.
this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.
The corned beef and pastrami are excellent, much less fatty than those big tourist places around Times Square.
Even though the restaurant was packed, we were seated promptly and even asked for a table upstairs with no problems.
From the terrible service, to the bland food, not to mention the unaccommodating managers, the overall experience was horrible.
The cafe itself was really nice with comfortable outdoor chairs and tables, but the service could have been better.
($200 for 2 glasses of champagne, not too expensive bottle of wine and 2 after dinner drinks).
$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.
I found the food, service and value exceptional everytime I have been there.
the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass.
It was not above ordinary and the beef version had cheap (undercooked) beef.
I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.
this is the best secret place in midtown', I heard that from the bartender, after having brilliant food ( try steak with portobello mushrooms) and drinks on the bar last Tuesday.
I am reluctant to write because I would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded.
I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
The menu is nothing like the one on the website.
Plus, when our entrees were held up in the kitchen on a busy Saturday night, the owner sent over complimentary summer rolls to hold us over!
(food was delivered by a busboy, not waiter) We got no cheese offered for the pasta, our water and wine glasses remained EMPTY our entire meal, when we would have easily spent another $20 on wine.
And the bill was outragous.
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.
Great bagels, spreads and a good place to hang out in.
Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.
Especially liked chicken tikka and the naan, and the dals.
I'd call it an 'italian dinner'.
Emilio, the owner, is often sitting in the front table greeting guests as they come and go.
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.
The bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines.
yourself a favor and have dinner here and see if you dont agree with me.
The octopus eaters were floored by the Octopus salad.
You can certainly find restaurants that offer a superior fine dining experience, but for superb food at reasonable prices, La Villa can't be beat.
Pair you food with the excellent beers on tap or their well priced wine list.
At the end you're left with a mild broth with noodles that you can slurp out of a cup.
While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.
If you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!
The wine selection (by the glass and bottle) is wonderful and I always recommend that friends make a reservation if they're going to be in town.
The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.
The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.
Over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason.
I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.
But don't ever order bacon late at nite (either platter or in sandwiches, for that matter don't from any take out place) as it is from the morning frying turns out hard almost like bacos, hurt my molars.
bottles of wine are cheap and good.
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.
I would highly recommend Nina's to anyone who wants to have a romantic dinner in a heart warming surrounding filled with candles and family pictures.
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to escargot.
Very romantic fires - I've literally spent hours at Lanterna, drinking wine from their extensive wine and enjoying the ambience.
The Pad Thai is excellent here, as well.
The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.
The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.
The prices are about $9 for an entree for dinner and even less for lunch.
good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.
Please if your thinking about it go, and stay the wait you won't be disappointed.
Food is excellent.
As soon as my father lifted his pen from the check a chef appeared to usher us out.
Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.
The food is awesome - definitely try the striped bass.
We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.
Good crowd, good outdoor seating, with a hip japanese vibe.
Considering their price of $6.25 for lunch special, the dish was ridiculously small.
Cornelia Street looks like a Broadway set for West Side Story and the inside of Po is so cool quaint you really can't top the setting for a romantic dinner in NYC.
Average to good Thai food, but terrible delivery.
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.
Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.
Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.
The staff has always been attentive and kind, and I've always been amazed at how they've handled all the various different group sizes that come in.
It was so bad I actually refused to pay for my food.
The location and ambience is Ok but the food is what makes up for it.
We arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly.The
And the staff is also young, energeic and hot!!!!
While I quite liked the food and the ambience, I'm not quite sure if it they really deserve it the Michelin rating they have displayed so prooudly in the window.
BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.
All of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better!
All my co-workers were amazed at how small the dish was.
The menu was impressive with selections ranging from a burger, to steak, to escargot.
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
The overall price tag was very very expensive, something I did expect.
Restaurant snobs need not bother, this is a small, neighborhood kind of place.
and you can't beat the prices.
night without a reservation, we had to wait at the bar for a little while, but the manager was so nice and made our wait a great experience.
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.
Very good service and very good prices.
Not impressed with the food.
The ambience is very romantic and definitely a good place to bring a date.
We shared a bottle of sake, an order of edamames, and she had the sushi plate while I had the sashimi.
$20 gets you unlimited sushi of a very high quality- I even took a friend here from Japan who said it was one of the best sushi places in the US that he has been to.
The pizza is the best if you like thin crusted pizza.
They treated us well and the food was extremely fresh and well-prepared.
Great pizza for lunch place.
We were on our way back to NJ, and since I am in NY, we figured why not grab some food?
It is far more popular as a bar than as a restaurant, with only a few tables and the waiter being the bartender, but we greatly enjoyed the unobtrusive atmosphere.
The flavors are great, and the menu is extensive.
Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
They couldn't even make a salad that was appealing.
However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.
We had great desserts (including the best cannoli I've ever had) and then they offered an after dinner drink, on the house.
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.
Try the green curry!!!
Nicky the Nose at the bar is a treat.
The staff was too busy ordering sushi for dinner and then laying it out to eat on the bar to even bring me my check.
I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.
Super friendly and knowledgable staff, fabulous bistro fare and a wonderful jazz brunch with great live jazz (the chilaquiles were awesome!
The Singapore Mai Fun had NO curry flavor whatsoever.
The zucchini and mashed potatoes are a blend of garlic and butter which simply melts in your mouth.
Consistently good Japanese Tapas.
The steak was very fatty and the sauce was overpowering and not very tasty.
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.
Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!
We figured we never had Argentinian Pizza before so we grabbed our lunch there, sharing a large Pelligrino, a pizza of two of their specials, one was goat cheese the other blue cheese, and both were excellent.
Try the chocolate mud cake (warmed) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato.
We had a party in their private room and they made it truly memorable and were very helpful in the planning.
Quite frankly, this is some of the worst sushi I have ever tried.
Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.
not the food ,not the ambiance , not the service, I agree with the previous reviews you wait and wait , the wait staff are very rude and when you get in they are looking to get you right out .
My friend's food was also the complete opposite of what it's supposed to taste like (aND look like).
Very good wine choices.
The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great.
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats.
I have had so many dinners here and it's always been perfect - on a date with my husband, with my mom, with girlfriends and larger groups.
But they've done a really nice job of offering all the typical pizzeria faves plus some terrific specials like the Godmother pizza (a sort of traditional flat pizza with an olive oil-brushed crust and less tomato sauce than usual).
Good, fast service.
People are always friendly.
The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.
The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.
They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.
The dishes offered were unique, very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages, sardines with biscuits, large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream (the best and freshest I've ever had).
The staff is very attentive and we can almost always get a table.
The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.
There is no excuse for such lousy service!
Prices are higher to dine in and their chicken tikka marsala is quite good.
The food, drinks and service are clearly among the best in the city.
The staff is very kind and well trained, they're fast, they are always prompt to jump behind the bar and fix drinks, they know details of every item in the menu and make excelent recomendations.
one of the best Chicken Tikka Masala.
The spicy tuna and salmon are the best we've ever had.
And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.
From the appetizers we ate, the dim sum and other variety of foods, it was impossible to criticize the food.
A cool place to hang with your friends for a couple of healthy drinks and desserts.
While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich, Katz's has a charm about it.
(and I have eaten my share) Which impresses me for having such a large amount of people to serve.
Moules were excellent, lobster ravioli was VERY salty!
Food was OK - fish was cooked well.
All we received was an apology as we left to see our show without dinner.
After we got our sashimi order, I could not believe how small the portions were!
While the $20 entree range is not overly expensive, in New York City, there is definitely better food in that range, and so Sapphire, despite it's lovely atmosphere, will most likely not be a restaurant to which I will return.
The space is a bit too small for live music, so on  jazz nights, it can be loud and cramped.
Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.
This place is incredibly tiny.
The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant.
My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque.
They sell special sushi, everything have a topping, sauce and etc.
Also, if you don't want to sit at a certain table, you don't have to!
I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.
Appetizers are somewhere around $7 each and the main dishes are between $11 and $16.
A narrow corridor leads to a tiny space where there are three tiny white tiled counters, a great deal of mess (stacks of bottles, cans) and a small counter holding 12-14 entrees.
The appetizers are just OK and the main courses were decidedly subpar.
Get the soup and a nosh (pastrami sandwich) for $8 and you're golden.
The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.
In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.
Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared.
Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.
The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.
In terms of the food itself -- nothing special, we limited ourselves to several appetizers.
Last memorial day, I tried to make reservations but was told they were closed that weekend (interesting, but...).
They have a very diverse menu so its something for everybody.
My goodness, everything from the fish to the rice to the seaweed was absolutely amazing.
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money.
The prices were fantastic.
If you love wine and cheese and delicious french fare, you'll love Artisanal!
Yes, there might be a wait if you have no reservations.
The dish had like 6 pieces of beef in it.
We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!
The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.
The price was extremely reasonable for the appetizers and food we ate.
Overall I was impressed and will return, it's a great QPR (Quality to Price Ratio).
it's a perfect place to have a amanzing indian food.
The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.
The food is uniformly exceptional, with a very capable kitchen which will proudly whip up whatever you feel like eating, whether it's on the menu or not.
Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York.
My wife and I went to Orsay for Valentine's dinner.
I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.
Oh, don't even let me start with how expensive the bills were!
The environment is romantic, but the food is horrible, the service is pathetic, and gabriella lies about everything she could.
When he finally did, he was unable to make a gin and tonic -- couldn't find tonic.
Interesting selection, good wines, service fine, fun decor.
Try ordering from the regular menu, then you would not regret!
The menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.
The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.
The music does get a little loud at times, but it just made me want to lean closer to my beautiful wife, and as I did, I got a whiff of corriander.
Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.
And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.
$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an appetizer and drinks.
The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.
Good, because hey, it's more food, but bad because dim sum is supposed to be smaller portions so you can try out more dishes and smaller so that each dish is cheap.
Even better, they know how to cook French classics like Steak au Poivre and Onglet without burning it to death or overcooking it.
Over time, the food quality has decreased substantially, it is a lot less crowded than it used to, and the service must definitely be part of the reason.
The desserts are more appealing then stuffy overpriced French restaurants.
We asked to be moved (which took half an hour), and then were seated in a high traffic area in the back, even though the rest of the room was practically empty.
The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.
This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.
You can even get packages of the chutneys to stock your fridge!
Average to good Thai food, but terrible delivery.
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!
A glass of Leaping Lizard, a glass of prosecco, and the mussels had everything happy.
Its an excellent place to relax and the food is one of the best in the city of New York.
The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce, but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I've tried similar dishes at.
Priced at upper intermediate range.
I was really disappointed ant wanted to tell everyone not to go eat or even take out food from there.
Stay away from the two specialty rolls on the menu, though- too much avocado and rice will fill you up right quick.
This is definitely an  excellent date spot because of the ambiance and on the weekends the  night scene is more than alive.
Succulent steaks cooked precisely to your desired 'doneness' accompanied by salads and sides that don't look like leafy road kill.
The buffet had a nice selection.
Chance is a small cozy restaurant, with a romantic feel to it, the decor is great.
The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.
Great food, great lay out and awesome service.
Great romantic place for a date (try to get the corner booth table for a little privacy and to sit close!).
The palak paneer was standard, and I was not a fan of the malai kofta.
Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).
They are served with a free appetizer and the portions are perfect for lunch.
The eggplant parmesan is also great, and my friend who grew up in Manhattan claims that no one serves a better baked ziti with meatsauce.
The service is always bad though, don't expect much of anything from your server, and I would not recommend bringing a date here either.
The flavors robust and subtle.
We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.
kalbi and nebbiolo do work together.
All I can say is $2 pints during happy hour and the some of the cheapest oysters you'll find in the city, though the quality is some of the best.
The takeout menu says to keep an eye out for an expanded menu offering more italian dishes, I can't wait!
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
The production is a symphony, alot of fun to experience.The food sublime for the most part.
Ive been here so many times the waiters know my name.
The view is spectacular, and the food is great.
The only friendly staff member was the guy at the bar.
All in all the food was above average and I would return to see how they operate with four or less dinners.
The service was mediocre, and the lack of air conditioning made for a less than comfortable meal.
We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in thier food in evident.
It's a great place to pick up a cheap lunch or dinner.
Try green curry with vegetables.
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.
The food was amazing, and the service was prompt and helpful, but not over-bearing or rushed.
Food was average and creme brulee was awful - the sugar was charred, not caramelized and smelled of kerosene.
Quality of food is excellent and price is cheap, stick to pork, fish, chicken, lamb and vegetables.
To begin, we were told there was a 30 minute wait and started to leave, when the hostess offered to call us on our cell phone when the table was ready.
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.
I REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOWS PUT ON BY THE ACTORS.
I noted it was crossed off on the bill.
The quality of food at this restaurant accompanied  by fantastic live jazz makes this place a perfect 10!
This wasn't the expected menu comprised only of pad thai and tom yum soup, but I thought that was what made the place so special.
Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.
While the place is not a hotspot hangout, the drinks are unique and pack a lot of bang for the buck.
The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week's notice.
For some reason, all the seafood on the menu was unavailable except for the Salmon.
I recommend the meatballs and caprese salad and the beans on toast were a wonderful start to the meal!
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat).
I would like to return and try some of the other menu items when I don't have to rush off to a show.
The man that was hosting promised to save a table for our party of 7, then sat a party of 2 at the very table he was saving (mean while there were boths open all around).
The waiters were not attentive except that the bill turned up on the table before we were finished.
The vibe is very relaxed and cozy, service was great and the food was excellent!
The bruschetta and panini's are so yummy!
I have never better enjoyed humble root vegetables or a mushroom consomme - and this chef accomplishes without fats.
To my right, the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six.
Our server checked on us maybe twice during the entire meal.
After the main course came, we didn't see our waiter for at least 40 MINUTES!
Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.
service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.
Regardless of whether there are two people or two hundred people ahead of you the hostess will take your name and tell you Five minutes.
The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.
We had the pot-stickers which were great and a tempura dish that was great.
Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.
After my 3rd time the manager remembered me and treated me like an usual customer.
We began with the cheese fondue (the artisanal blend) and added apples and kielbasa to dip.
Their wines by the glass are a great accompaniment and you can eat like a king with wine for under $30.
We made early dinner reservations and were thoroughly impressed, reminds me of my grandfather, its old school Italian scenery with lots of fun stuff to admire.
The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).
The prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village.
Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.
Service was prompt, friendly and great.
The fried rice is really good too.
The wait staff is friendly, and the food has gotten better and better!
Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.
Waiters tend to forget drinks completely, food portions are so tiny, two people have trouble sharing one entree.
The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.
I must warn the reader that the portions sizes are very small (especially the appetizers), so if you plan to eat until you are full and do not intend to order the chef's special tasting menu, prepare to order and pay for an appetizer (1 dish for each person because the portions are not for sharing), a main entree, and the cold udon at the end of the meal.
Service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded.
Our tiny table for two (dinner plates hung over edge) was right in the middle of one of the lanes of waiter traffic.
Taxan delicious!
but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.
Three courses - choices include excellent mussels, puff pastry goat cheese and salad with a delicious dressing, and a hanger steak au poivre that is out of this world.
The food is o.k., but not any better than what you get at a good neighborhood restaurant.
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.
One of my favorites though was the Angry Lobster, a cold lobster salad that was magnificent.
The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.
i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.
My fish was delicious in an incredible curry sauce.
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.
The sauce on the pizza is sooo good with garlic and fresh tomatoes and they don't skimp.
If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.
The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.
The food inludes famous scrumptious bombay style chaat such as bhelpuri, sevpuri and samosa chaats, as well as other great indian appetizers.
$160 for 2 filets, 2 sides, an appetizer and drinks.
The atmosphere is much better than Sripraphai (more modern and sleek).
While the food was excellent, it wasn't cheap (though not extremely expensive either).
My host asked for appetizers for the group and the waiter gave us not only what we ordered, but some other items that were not ordered.
We were seated promptly as we had reservations, however after that the service was slow.
Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average.
They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.
Two words: Free wine.
For the quality of food, a little too expensive.
As we were leaving, the couple standing by the door said to another waiter, we're not in a hurry.
A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer.
Dessert - can't be missed, so save room!!!
We were still sitting at the bar while we drank the sangria, but facing away from the bar when we turned back around, the $2 was gone the people next to us said the bartender took it.
They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.
Everything, from the soft bread, soggy salad, and 50 minute wait time, with an incredibly rude service to deliver below average food.
First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.
As we were sitting eating the subpar food the manager proceeded to berate a couple of his employees for putting out the wrong containers for condiments and explained to them how expensive these containers were.
I've had pizza both times and the caprese salad appetizer.
I plan to come here again and look forward to trying their assortment of bruschetta, panini's.....
They do cater to American palates, but if you like it hot let them know and they are more than willing to oblige!
Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.
It saves walking in and waiting for a table in the often noisy, crowded bar at dinnertime.
Zero ambiance to boot.
the real kicker of the menu, however, is the beef cubes or the chicken with chili and lemon grass.
The pesto pizza was excellent, thin-crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy Italian cheese that I'd never heard of before.
Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.
like saying her bread comes from a special bakery when we have seen her buying it dowtown manhathan.
NO more reservations, expensive tips and annoying stuff.
people are rude bit again it's new york!
The menu changed, portions were even smaller than before, a lentil dish was salty beyond edibility, a basmati rice dish lacked flavor.
We ran a little late for the reservation but it wasn't a problem to get our table immediately.
The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.
Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.
The quail was fantastic and unique and the pastas were full of flavor.
The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.
If your favorite Chinese food is General Tao chicken, then this is NOT your place.
The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.
Dip the ingredients in with your chopsticks, swirl them around, and eat.
The service, wine selection, ambiance are all outstanding and deserve recognition.
However, they've got the most amazing pastrami and the soups hit the spot.
We went to eat at the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant on Friday night and really enjoyed the fun atmosphere and good food.
uni from maine vs california, sea vs freshwater eel) to get a good taste comparison.
The makhani was OK --the korma was bland.
Though you will undoubtedly be seated at a table with what seems like barely enough room (no matter what the size of your party), the warm atomosphere is worth the cramped quarters- you'll have fun and forgot about the tight spot you're in.
The space is nice but when we order our drink we were in for a surprise.
They even have a section in the menu called American Chinese food!
I always get the Shabu-Shabu dinner and the beef is always fresh.
I ordered tamarind duck and my wife ordered noodles with ground beef, and we were both delighted by the way the dishes evoked Thai flavors in unexpected ways.
Meat dishes now adorn the selections, although there's still a large number of vegetarian-friendly choices.
There was a long wait for a table outside, but it was a little too hot in the sun anyway so our insde table was very nice.
My husband had the mesclun, salmon, and ice cream and he enjoyed all 3 courses.
The bruscetta is a bit soggy, but the salads were fresh, included a nice mix of greens (not iceberg) all dishes are served piping hot from the kitchen.
Fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.
Good food.
We always get a sampling of appetizers and share.
Immediately after we paid, the waiter took the money and said, okay, you guys are outta here.
i've been back to nha trang literally a hundred times for the beef cubes - they're that good.
The food is great and authentic.
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
The food was delicious and the waiter was incredibly helpful and attentive (considering we were the only ones there for the first hour).
Food was OK - fish was cooked well.
The service is friendly, if not the most prompt in the world, the food is great, and the prices, while not cheap, won't put your wallet out of commission.
The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great.
After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.
After complaining about the chicken dish, the manager came over to tell us that, no one had ever complained before, and that we just didn't know what the dish was supposed to taste like.
The steak is good, the fish is good and the sushi was surprisingly great.
For the people who want great food plus great service, Roxy is a place to AVOID!
Ambience is delightful, service impeccable.
Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.
But when you are seated the waitresses are great, they explain everything on the menu, and the price of the food is really cheap for the service you get.
I had the tuna tartare with sake, mushroom ravioli with pinot noir, and the chocolate sampler with a dessert wine for $49.
I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.
Food-awesome.
The menu seemed to have a wide variety of dishes for seafood lovers and interesting ways of preparing them.
I would have gotten some cole slaw and a knish if my stomach had more space.
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.
Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service.
The food was pretty good, but a little flavorless and the portions very small, including dessert.
During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.
I had the salmon dish and while it was fine, for the price paid, I expected it to have some type of flavor.
Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.
Highly recommend this as great value for excellent sushi and service.
The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.
Service is friendly, prices are good - delivery time was a little slow, but for the way this pizza tastes, I'm willing to overlook it.
The menu looked good, except for offering the Chilean Sea Bass, but the server does not offer up the specials that were written on the board outside.
Although be warned their dinner menu to sit and take out prices are different.
We could only get through an appetizer and cheese fondue.
Hats off to the chef.
Food is great.
I recommend the garlic shrimp, okra (bindi), and anything with lamb.
Other than being a little crowded and a bit overpriced, the atmosphere is filled with energy (and the beautiful people of course) and the food was surprising good!
I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.
Taj Mahal offeres gret value and great food.
If you want some roast duck, pork or chicken on rice with ginger, try them out!
I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.
The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.
This place must have cost the owners afortune to build.
The food is great.
The service was a bit slow, but they were very friendly.
My husband and I both ordered the Steak, medium.
If anyones has doubt of not knowing enough about wines,please check their wine list.
Check it out, it won't hurt your stomach or your wallet.
We a menu that rearely changes,e xcept for one or two specials, the quality and care they put in thier food in evident.
If I could rate the people this place would be off the charts - unfortunately - the pizza, sorry - not the best in NYC.
In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.
Whenever you need a Sushi fix, Mizu will be there with quality fish and great service.
Turned out there was full service upstairs and sat down.
The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.
The combination of fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozz cheese, basil and the dough they make with imported flour, makes this is one of the better pizza's in NY.
Excellent lunch buffet for only $6.95.
In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.
My wife and I also enjoyed the spinach, the Shanghai low mein, and other attractions.
It's a place for people who pay a lot for mediocre food, noise and a chance to be with their fellow bridge and tunnel folks.
Decor is minimalist and clean - nothing to distract or commend.
INCREDIBLY POOR SERVICE AN FOOD QUALITY AT EXORBITANT PRICES.
We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.
If you want a casual neighborhood bistro that has great food and excellent service, this is the place.
For those prices and the dressed up atmosphere you expect more and should get more.
The plain pizza was soggy and the creative wild mushroom(third generation-Fornini) pizza we had was drenched with truffle oil in the middle( again making it soggy) and nothingon the rest.
The red curry is weak and tasteless, the pad thai is stuck together and lumpy, the rice is often overcooked, and the seafood is pretty sketchy.
The sushi is also great!
I only tried a simple dish of spinach ravioli in a light oil and garlic sauce, but it actually faired better than most NYC Italian joints I've tried similar dishes at.
They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.
Service is fast and friendly.
The service was excellent - friendly and attentive.
First, the waiter who served us neglected to fill us in on the specials, which I would have chosen had I known about them.
We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
This place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, value, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion.
I understand the area and folks you need not come here for the romantic, alluring ambiance or the five star service featuring a sommlier and a complicated maze of captain and back waiters - you come for the authentic foods, the tastes, the experiance.
Food was okay, nothing great.
The white bean brushetta to start was incredible and the pasta was phenomenal.
The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
Knowledge of the chef and the waitress are below average.
I just wonder how you can have such a delicious meal for such little money.
The establishment scores big points in presentation and style.
This is a cute place and could be good but they need to get their act together.
Prices are in line.
The chicken parm was edible but had canned tomato sauce and boxed pasta and the chicken with portobello mushrooms consisted of dry, inedible chicken with terrible sauce.
Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.
No food snobs allowed, this place is for people who appreciate good food.
This place doesn't compare with Mamoun's in terms of price, freshness, value, and consisent quality, but that's just my opinion.
fine dining restaurant quality.
With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.
I have been here a few times for dinner, once for brunch and twice for lunch.
I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.
The puke green walls leave a lot to be desired, but the food is very good.
I recommend their Pad See Ew, Pork Chops or Tofu plates.
The service was bad, the food took to forever to come, we sat on the upper level.
I highly recommend Cafe St. Bart's for their food, the ambience and wonderful service.
The Halibut was too salty, dessert was so so (don't waste any of your calories) and service was poor.
I took my girlfriend there for her birthday last night and we had a relaxing, really good meal.
In reality (to maximize potential diners) they were still taking phone reservations and reallocating tables of those waiting in the lobby.
Drinks got screwed up, she acted put upon.
When we were finally seated our waitress came by twice-1 for our order and 2-for our check.
Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area.
Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.
The food was below average, the service was pathetic, there was no ambience at all.
The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.
Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.
Salads were fantastic.
The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.
I've been to Naples 45 for dinner twice.
It's constantly open, catering to the Pakistani cabbies lined up on Crosby St., so there's more turnover with the food than you'd expect (i.e., surprisingly fresh).
From the complimentary chef app of a delicate butternut squash ravioli in a delicious truffle sauce to an amazing buttery and tender langostine entree to a dessert that I can't remember because of the fabulous Cakebread Cabernet we were drinking -- the whole evening was amazing.
While they keep the capex to a minimum, they do put some cash into the bagels, because they among the best in the city.
Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.
We've been to Grocery three times and not once has an item on the menu disappointed.
A very inviting restaurant, with friendly service.
To my right, the hostess stood over a busboy and hissed rapido, rapido as he tried to clear and re-set a table for six.
We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.
He offers subpar service and has no personality.
Deliveries often take up to an hour and the prices are higher than most other pizzerias in the area.
Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.
I went with 5 friends and we lingered at the table for a bit and didn't feel rushed at all even though there was a wait.
The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!
They're also friendlier here, especially the owner, Kenny.
Guacamole+shrimp appetizer was really great, we both had the filet, very good, didn't much like the frites that came with, but the filet was so good, neither of us cared.
The service is ok, some of the people didn't get what they asked for.
The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.
Sure, the setting is nice.
The food is spectacular, from the appitizers to the main course, and then of course the desserts, (WOW) you'll need no more.
In such a crappy part of town to find a good value for lunch, this place is great.
The selection changes frequently but the basic dishes are always available.
The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.
The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.
The service is a bit slow, but harkens back to my years growing up in Napoli, Italy where things are not rushed and when you sit down for dinner the table is yours all night.
The steak was excellent and one of the best I have had (I tasted the butter intitally but in no way did it overwhelm the flavor of the meat).
Unless you are eating in the Pizzeria side of this place, and are not in a rush, this place is a bad idea.
While most people can attest to spending over $50 on drinks in New York bars and hardly feeling a thing, the drinks here are plentiful and unique.
It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.
I grew up eating Dosa and have yet to find a place in NY to satisfy my taste buds.
Unlike HH up the block, this place actually gives you hearty and hot bagels this town is known for.
Great food, great prices, great service.
We parked on the block of Nina's the place looked nice, with people obviously enjoying their pizzas.
It's super-trendy and there's always someone to take that empty seat, so it seems that customer service has been deemed not of the essence.
The food was terrific and the service classy, attentive, without being overbearing.
The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.
They did not have mayonnaise, forgot our toast, left out ingredients (ie cheese in an omelet), below hot temperatures and the bacon was so over cooked it crumbled on the plate when you touched it.
Interesting other dishes for a change include chicken in curry sauce and salmon caserole.
Fabulous service, fantastic food, and a chilled out atmosphere and environment.
Several of the dim sum orders had about 6-8 pieces.
And I say snacking because it really is not set up to be a proper dinner.
The best thing I tasted were the lambchops.
It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
Great friendly service, Fast seating, Fast Delivery, Excellent sushi.
The dim sum here is only so-so.
The food came out wrong, the waiter was no where to be found and the wine showed up at the end of the meal.
We usually just get some of the dinner specials and they are very reasonably priced and very tasty.
Try the chocolate mud cake (warmed) with 2 scoops of dulce de leche gelato.
Quality ingredients preparation all around, and a very fair price for NYC.
Last time I went here, the waitress didn't come back after taking our order.
It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.
BUt their best dish is thh Thai spiced curry noodles with shrimp - a dish that would cost $23.95 is most places, but it is $16 here.
I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.
Delicious food, excellent service, and a pretty atmosphere make this a great choice for dinner and the $5.99 lunch buffet makes it an even better choice for lunch!
Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
From the incredible food, to the warm atmosphere, to the friendly service, this downtown neighborhood spot doesn't miss a beat.
Still, try it once, since if you end up loving the food, it could be one of your best dining experiences.
The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
First the wrong bread came out with the appetizer, then when i tried to order a second glass of wine for my main course...
Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!
We ended the dinner with a surprisingly light and flaky apple tarte tatin.
We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.
Only wine and beer are served, but the house varities are actually quite good.
We ate here in March, 2006 and ordered the pre-theatre 3-course dinner with wine flight.
The food was good.
I had the cod with paella (spicy and very filling, I'm a big eater and could only eat half) while my boyfriend had the classic fish and chips (again, a big serving - at least 5 pieces of fish and a basketful of fries).
$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.
We saw them heating up at least one frozen item though I'm not sure which dim sum dish it was.
Hopefully next time, I will save room for dessert.
When going out for a nice dinner, I like a nice ambiance as well as very good food.
Seating is ok even though sometimes there's alot of people.
Not only is the cuisine the best around, the service has always been attentive and charming.
